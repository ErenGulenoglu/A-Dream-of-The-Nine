    - Inside the manor is the richest place for miles. It has expensive furniture, maid and cook has clothes of the dynasty color, and at the center of the house, above the heart is a masterwork painting.
        - "The painting depicts a dramatic clash between two knights wielding longswords and clad in full plate armor. They are engaged in battle, their swords striking against each other in a fierce duel on a vast, white-stoned arena where sunlight reflects off the sand-covered ground. Spectators surround the scene, tossing rose petals that swirl gracefully through the air and into the arena. One knight is adorned in green and yellow, while the other wears #."
