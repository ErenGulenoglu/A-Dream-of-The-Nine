## Scene 1: Bad News
- The party returns with good and bad news. When Sialis reached to [[King's Stand]] with the remaining members of [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|Tribe of the Bear]], it has been 5 days since [[Robin Haddock]], [[Tommen of Al'Var]], [[Cran Nolast]], and [[Helen Nolast]] has left to seek a rare ingredient to prepare medicine for [[Sir Vincentas Orvyll]]. 
**Quest: Where is the prior party?**
- These NPCs may ask the party to search the prior party in the forest:
	- Sialis is worried that Robin and her group hasn't returned.
	- [[Father Quinten]] is worried that Tommen, the new _Subdeacon_ of the town has not returned.
	- [[Doran of Greentown|Captain Doran]], wants to know the faith of the medicine.
- Free time for characters to rest, talk with NPCs, and settle in King's Stand.
- Captain Doran learns the party's doings from Sialis, and rewards them **10 gp** per character. He only knows that party consists of three members, a warrior from [[Saltuarius Tribe]], a tiefling, and a dwarf.
## Scene 2: Revenge
- As the party makes their way into the forest to search for the previous group, they must succeed on a **DC 12 Survival** check to navigate the terrain.
    - On a result of **15 or higher**, they discover **fresh tracks** belonging to small humanoids — goblins.
    - On a result **above 15**, they also discover **older tracks** belonging to the prior party.
- After killing the previous adventuring party, the goblin scouts grew overconfident and began observing activity in [[King’s Stand]] from the forest. Three goblins are currently hiding in the bushes, spying on the town before regrouping deeper in the woods. **Norr**, the bugbear lieutenant of the [[Burned Claws Scout Camp]], sent these goblins on a distant scouting mission to keep them away from stealing loot from the adventurers they killed.
- If the goblins notice anyone approaching, **two** of them use their shortbows to fire at the intruders, taking the **Hide** action between attacks. The **third** goblin hides in bushes closer to the forest’s edge, waiting for a target to move within the foliage before ambushing them at melee range. When they are hidden, they attack with advantage.
	- **Ranged 1 Stealth DC, Initiative**: 12, 6
	- **Ranged 2 Stealth DC, Initiative**: 7, 16
	- **Melee 1 Stealth DC, Initiative**: 17, 19
- ==If a character’s **passive Perception equals or exceeds the goblin’s Stealth check**, the goblin is **not hidden from that character**, even if it is in a bush and the character is not. If goblin is in character's line of sight, they are seen by that character.==
**What the Goblins Know**  
If the characters capture or magically influence one of the goblins here, the goblin can be persuaded to share some useful information:
- Their tribe is called the [Burned Claws Tribe](app://obsidian.md/Burned%20Claws%20Tribe). Their chief’s name is [Cannibal Brits](app://obsidian.md/Cannibal%20Brits). The tribe’s main stronghold is in [Greentown](app://obsidian.md/Greentown). Brits wants to conquer King’s Stand before winter and end human dominance in the forest entirely. Brits has hobgoblin lieutenants and keeps a creature known as [Iennos, The Shadow](app://obsidian.md/Iennos,%20The%20Shadow) always at his side.
- There are two separate camps in the forest. The [main camp](app://obsidian.md/Shrine%20of%20Cleansing) is a ruined dwarven temple in the south of the forest. The [scout camp](app://obsidian.md/Burned%20Claws%20Scout%20Camp) is built atop a large rocky outcrop within the woods.
- The scout camp exists to monitor King’s Stand’s military movements. The main force, however, is gathered at the dwarven temple to the east.
- The scout camp also serves as a supply point. Supplies and new soldiers mounted on **worgs** are sent directly from Greentown to the southern camp. The camp is surrounded by traps.
- The scout camp currently houses 5 goblins and 1 bugbear. The bugbear’s name is **Norr**. **Norr** is one of Cannibal Brits’ lieutenants and is responsible for scouting operations and supply coordination in the forest.
