## Characters

Notes:
- [[Sialis]] is sent to north of [[Forlornwoods]] to bring the remaining [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods]] to [[King's Stand]].
- What is the conflict?
	- A monster is cutting their road.
	- They want to do this stealthy without revealing their movements to greenskin scouts. So they need capable warriors that would misguide the goblin's to false tracks.
	- There is a trapper bandit group killing off mountain man. Cutting them off from the mainland by holding off a bridge. This bandit group is working for greenskins. Mountain man can't hunt them down because of the traps they set in the forest. (This bandit group attacks and lures characters to northern forest.)
	- Blights are in the forest. Traveling through northern forest means heavy casualties. To make it secure. The blight understand the presesnce of creatures in the forest. More blight will come every hour spent in the forest. Adventurers are asked to find the source of the blight and eleminate it. With each passing hour, more blight will come. (THIS ONE IS GOOD.)
		- [[Nírëalda]]. Ancient plants twisted by evil, Gulthias blights feed on blood and despoil the surrounding land, often giving rise to subservient blights. These cursed plants take their name from the story of their creation; the first of their kind was a tree that grew from the stake piercing the heart of the vampire Gulthias. These blights consider all creatures either servants or fertilizer for the blights' corruption.
		- The tree is sleeping. There is two souls within this tree battling for control. This tree is an elf grave. The tree is tainted by touch of an evil.
		- Currently, the elf's soul forces death comatose on the tree for evil to not takeover. Once it wakes up, the blight will attack everything in the forest.
		- Somthing written on the tree with Druidic (Help, Sleep?)
	- Create another NPC for the tribe, maybe a rival for [[Kjall, son of Kjall]].
	- After coming to [[King's Stand]] give them option to track down dead character's trail. [[Father Quinten]] asks one of them to bring body of [[Tommen of Al'Var]], for him to be buried properly and sent off to the afterlife as a proper son of [[The Fighter]].
