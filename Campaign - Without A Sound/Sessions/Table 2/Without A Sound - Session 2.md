## Characters
- **[[Athena Lycaon]]:** Athena is a member of the [[Saltuarius Tribe]]. Her trauma stems from an orc raid that attacked her family when she was six years old. Her parents were killed in the attack, and when she later returned with a search group, they could not find the body of her brother, **Nyctimus**. This event fed her temper and hardened her warrior’s soul. Because of her inclination toward violent action, she did not make a good forager and was left in camp most of the time. As she was friends with [[Robin Haddock]], she also knew [[Sialis]] and became aware of views that strayed from the tribe’s practices. Four days after Robin and her party departed on a scouting mission, Athena invited her to join an escort mission north of the [[Forlornwoods]] to aid the remaining members of the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|Tribe of the Bear]]. Refusing to be left behind again, Athena followed her—first to complete the mission, then to find Robin and seek out Nyctimus, determined to prove herself as the true protector of her tribe.
- **[[Forge Moltin]]:** He is a 384-year-old hill dwarf. His clan, the _Moltins_, were trained in smithing, and he was raised in the [[Lost Mountains]]. He later came to live in [[Greentown]] after [[House Orvyll#^BertasOrvyll|Lord Bertas Orvyll]] lowered the taxes, working there as a smith. Eventually, however, he felt a calling from nature and decided to live within the Forlornwoods in a modest hut. He did not leave his home during the _War of Flames_, and all the life he had left behind in Greentown was destroyed. Green-skinned raiders and monstrous plants now prowl the wilds. Forge wanders its shadowed paths, hammer and flame in hand, defending what remains of his home and the nature he swore to protect. He is one of the last dwarves who refused to live far from his ancient, now-lost homeland.
- **[[Marsh Rivers|Spook]]:** A bastard born in [[Fascesstadt]], Marsh grew up on the streets of Voivode’s Bank and learned the delicate arts of bardcraft from his mentor and father figure, [[Leman of Al’Var]]. When his found family was hanged on accusations of assassinating the Doge, and his former allies began searching for him, he fled the city. In the days that followed, Marsh discovered a hidden compartment in his lyre. Inside lay [[Note From Mistress|a note]] and a small [[Alf Stone|alf stone]]. The note instructed its recipient to deliver the stone to [[Greenfort]], where it could be used to dissolve a barrier erected by [[Ard Caëd]] mages. All Marsh knows is that the stone must reach Greenfort—and that doing so may be the only way to repay his mentor for the family he was given, and lost.
## Scene 0: Opening
	"About three days after the deaths of Cran, Helen, Robin, and Tommen at the hands of a goblin scout party, the goblin tribe occupying Greentown in the western Forlornwoods is digging its claws closer toward King’s Stand. With the scouting party that went to an elven tomb to retrieve a component called the Heart Stone—needed to prepare a medicine to cure the sick Lord Sir Vincentas Orvyll—now dead, his regent grandson, Lord Vincas Orvyll, and his council are moving their final chess pieces through the forest to prepare against the now-certain siege that will reach King’s Stand before winter.
	With no help coming from SPQU, Forlornwoods is as lonely as ever. In Somnium, adventurers are always needed, and in fact, King’s Stand needs adventurers now more than ever. In a twist of fate, our characters—some of whom have lived their lives inside and near Forlornwoods, and some who are from entirely different parts of the Republic—are now restless. Because of recent developments in their lives and in the woods, they are seeking answers from the forest.
	Those who are in Forlornwoods mirror the spirit of the forest itself: the apocalypse has long since come, the Traveler has forgotten to claim their souls, and now they struggle to be reborn from their own ashes."
## Scene 1: The Party is Dead, Long Live The Party!
	"In such a place, near the end of September, King’s Stand—the farthest settlement of SPQU on its south-west border—is making a great effort to construct wooden fortification walls around the town. Everyone who is able to work has been called by Lord Vincas Orvyll to help complete the defenses. Men cut trees and gather wood from the forest surrounding the town, then process them into appropriate shapes in the town’s carpentry workshops, while women and youths carry materials. The town’s carpenter and his workers sets the stockades into trenches dug around the settlement, and the trenches are then closed by pouring dirt back in, making them solid and immovable walls.
	Amidst this effort, we see a woman who stands out among the male lumberjacks cutting trees. Her biceps pumped with blood. She grips a greataxe firmly in both hands as she chops the trees down."
- Let Athena introduce her character. Let her roll an **attack roll** or an **Athletics check** to see her performance in tree cutting (**DC/AC 10**).
- [[Sialis]] finds Athena while she is cutting trees. She has been tasked by Captain [[Doran of Greentown|Doran]] to lead the remaining members of the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|Bear Tribe]] to [[King's Stand]]. The remaining members of the Bear Tribe are stationed near the northern section of the [[Lost Mountains]], between the forest and the hills. They consist mostly of elders, women, and children, with some warriors.
    - Sialis asks Athena to join her in this task, as she may require a capable fighter who can move through the woods easily and without making noise.
- At the noon, they set out on the road. Sialis takes the main road east first, traveling **30 miles at a fast pace**, to avoid diving directly into the forest while they are still a small group. They will ultimately spend more time within the forest, but by staying farther from its center it is safer, as this keeps them away from strange things that lurk inside the forest. Sialis travels at a **fast pace**. She plans to guide the tribe through the forest, as the longer they remain gathered in one place, the more blight will be drawn to them.
    - The eastern side of Forlornwoods consists of softwoods such as pines and other needle-leaved trees. It is less colorful than the western side beyond the _Rock River_. There are few leaves on the ground, despite the autumn season.
- During their first long rest, around 8 at night, while Athena and Sialis are resting at the camp, Moltin emerges from the forest, followed shortly by Marsh coming from the road.
    - Sialis does not allow the party to light campfires near the forest and warns the others that fire draws the attention of all kinds of dangerous things within the woods.
- Sialis asks Marsh and Moltin to join them in their quest.
- Downtime activities.
	- Moltin can gather herbs for crafting healing potions. If Moltin has a herbalism kit, he can attempt to brew a potion of healing.
	- Characters who are proficient in Survival can forage.
	- And more...
## Scene 2: Towards the Northern Lost Mountains
- At the first light of morning, Sialis leads the party north through the forest. Ask them marching order.
- While they are on their way, four small humanoid-shaped creatures rush at them from within the forest. They are covered in thorns, vines, and leaves, with skin like tree bark. They twitch and shake as they move. Four **twig blights** charge the party and attack. This is not turn-based combat; let each party member take a turn. On a failure, a character takes **3 piercing damage**, but the party manages to destroy all of the creatures.
- After this brief fight, the journey north continues smoothly without further danger. Any observant eye can see that Sialis is an excellent scout, and the party neither slows down nor becomes confused in the forest, not even for a moment. Without Sialis, those unskilled in forest travel would certainly become lost.
## Scene 3: Camp of the Remaining Tribe
	“As you emerge from the forest and climb one of the hills lying between the woods and the mountains, the northern Lost Mountains rise before you at close range. They are taller and more massive than anything you have seen before. There is a strange feeling in knowing that the dwarven clans of the Lost Mountains once filled the settlements of House Orvyll, yet now their homes stand abandoned and no one lives in these peaks.
	As you scan the hills, about a half-hour’s walk away, you spot a camp: approximately ten tents pitched atop a high hill, a small number of sheep and goats grazing nearby, and people moving between the tents. This is likely the camp of the Bear Tribe you are searching for.”
- [[Barga]], nephew of [[Kjall, son of Kjall]], is leading the people of the camp. Barga is waiting for the lord’s warriors to arrive and escort the remaining members of his people to King’s Stand. Once the party arrives, Barga takes them to his tent, where he stays when he is not on watch.
    - (Barga does not know House Orvyll, nor does he understand _lord_ as a title. He believes “Lord” to be the name of a man who was once an enemy of his people, back when they were strong.)
    - Barga knows the monstrosities the forest gives birth to. He has ordered that no fires be lit in the camp, as the creatures are drawn to flame. Everyone wears blankets, as the hills are windy and cold.
    - Barga knows that the monstrosities in the forest know their place, no matter how well his warriors hide.
    - Barga knows that more monstrosities appear as more warriors gather in the forest.
    - Barga knows the monstrosities come from the southwest side of the forest, where there once stood a great tree.
- The camp consists of approximately forty people. Ten of them are capable of fighting; the rest are elders, the sick, women, and children. Ten warriors are always on guard, watching the forest and taking shifts. Approximately every two hours, a group of four to six monstrosities (blights) rushes the camp violently before being brought down by the warriors. The camp has been waiting here for the past three days. Barga knows that if they do not cross to the other side soon, the forest will create and send even more of these creatures.
- Sialis explains to the party that they should take the shortest path through the forest, which runs through its center and can be crossed in four hours, if they wish to avoid drawing swarms by taking the safer road they used to reach the camp.
    - She adds that if they do not want all the monstrosities in the forest converging on the remaining tribe, they will need a distraction. Sialis asks the party to create a distraction by moving west, while she leads the tribe south.
- Depending on the time of day, with four more hours of travel remaining, Sialis and Barga will gather the camp and march them through the woods, trying to reach King's Stand before the sun fully sets.
## Scene 4: Distraction
- As the tribe, led by Sialis and Barga, moves south toward King’s Stand through the forest, the party leaves the group after a while and heads west to create a distraction.
    - Roll **Survival DC 15** to navigate west without getting lost. On a failure, the party still moves west but is unable to discern the return path.
**Fighting Off Blights**
- If the party decides to distract the blights by killing a considerable portion of them, they face a [Swarm of Twig Blights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1321710-swarm-of-twig-blights) and 2 [Needle Blights](https://5e.tools/bestiary/needle-blight-mm.html). Once the party manages to defeat the blights, a considerable number of swarms change their route, following the party instead of the tribe on its way to King’s Stand.
**Nírëalda**
- If the party decides to move deeper into the forest for a more effective solution, or becomes lost, after fighting off the blights they find [[Nírëalda]]. Nírëalda is a corrupted maple tree sprouted from the bodies of elven warriors who fought during the siege of Greenfort and were buried beneath the soil.
    - There is a mark of a hand pressed into the tree. From this mark, rot and corruption spread through the bark.
    - The tree bears a druidic message, a sign carved into itself, meaning _help, friend_.
    - Nírëalda is fighting against an evil force attempting to take hold of it. To resist this, the tree has placed itself into a state of sleep, almost comatose, to prevent the corruption from gaining control. Unwillingly, it creates the blights within the forest. To understand the tree’s struggle, characters may roll **DC 15 Nature** or **Arcana**.
    - Casting _Sleep_, healing spells, or equivalent magic on the tree aids its struggle to maintain control against the invading evil. As a result, all blights in the forest fall asleep for two weeks.
    - If the tree is attacked, Nírëalda fails in its struggle to retain control. Instead, a [Tree Blight](https://5e.tools/bestiary/tree-blight-cos.html) prematurely awakens and rampages through the forest.
- Nírëalda is surrounded by hordes of blights growing and forming around it. Most are dormant and still developing, but if the players proceed without caution, some may awaken early.
- If the party comes within 15 feet of the tree, all blights in the forest become unaware of their presence.
## Scene 5: Return Path
- If the party deepened the sleep of Nírëalda, the forest becomes mostly safe, aside from normal wildlife and animals. Roll **Survival DC 15** to track their way back to King’s Stand.
    - In other cases, the forest remains dangerous. **End the session here**, and begin the next session with a combat encounter that carries them toward home.
- The distance between Nírëalda and King’s Stand is **4 hours** at a normal pace. If the party travels beyond their limit, roll a **Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1** for each hour past 8 hours of travel.
- By the time the party reaches King’s Stand, the remaining members of the tribe will already be in the town. Roll a situation **d20**:
    - If the party succeeded in their mission, a result of **11 or higher** means no losses; **10 or lower** results in **1d4** losses.
    - If the party failed their mission, the result is **2d10** losses for the tribe.
## Scene 6: Lost Ones
- [[Doran of Greentown]] meets the party and rewards them with **10 gold pieces each**.
- Doran asks them if they are willing to take on another task: to find a scouting party that set out days ago to retrieve a medicinal ingredient for Lord Vincentas but has not returned, and to bring the medicine back if possible.
