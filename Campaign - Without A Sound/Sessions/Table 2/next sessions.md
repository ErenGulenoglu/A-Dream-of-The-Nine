They are engaged in battle, their swords striking against each other in a fierce duel on a vast, white-stoned arena where sunlight reflects off the sand-covered ground. Spectators surround the scene, tossing rose petals that swirl gracefully through the air and into the arena. One knight is adorned in green and yellow, while the other wears #."
