## Characters

## Scene 0: Opening
	"About twenty years after the War of Flames... The world has lost an Alf tree, and the ruins of the war are still being repaired. In SPQU, the nobles who remain from the Kingdom of Utland are attempting to establish a republic and reconsolidate their former authority; in the senate at the capital Ewyngard, days are marked by increasingly louder debates among senators about reconquest plans over the separatist states.
	In the south, the High Forest and Low Forest elves are struggling against a darkness rising beyond the southern reaches of the Endless Forest. In Veretia, the Gnomes—whose city was reduced to rubble—strive to cling to life, working day and night to build new settlements.
	Sensing this instability across the land, the green-skinned peoples have begun moving eastward from the tundras of the Giant’s Foothills—toward the lands of the awakened.
	It is in such a time that our characters have set out—unknowingly of one another—toward the town of King’s Stand, the only settlement within the Forlornwoods, where the Stone River splits the land in two, the north and south encircled by the Lost Mountains. The town lies within the fiefdom of the Orvyll Dynasty, on the southwestern frontier that is only partially considered part of SPQU and bound to no province.
	The Forlornwoods indeed a place deeply scarred by the War of Flames. Before the war, this was a vital trade route—though rarely—where elven, human, and dwarven goods crossed paths. But with the war it was devastated, and, true to its name, it once again became a forest utterly alone.
	And in truth, those who come here mirror the spirit of the forest itself: the apocalypse has long since come, the Wanderer has forgotten to claim their souls, and now they struggle to be reborn from their own ashes."
## Scene 1: By the Fire  
	"In such a place, right in the middle of September, on an autumn evening… On the eastern outskirts of the Forlornwoods, about an hour before nightfall, along the main stone road… Amidst the sounds of insects and the chirping of birds; within the green thickets of pines and conifers, someone walks along, their clothes carrying the dust and soil of the road."
-  One or more of the players travels towards [[King's Stand]].
- By the roadside, in a small clearing between the trees, a campfire is burning. A bag has been left by the fire. Here, another player (or players) can be seen. Let the characters introduce themselves. Encourage the characters to stay at the camp together.
- Shortly after, another player witnesses the same scene and approaches along the main road.
- Give players time for roleplay. Allow them the opportunity to introduce themselves.
- And as night falls, from the forest, strange beings begin to follow one of the players: their bodies appear humanoid at first, but upon closer look are covered with thorns, vines, and leaves; their skin resembles tree bark, and they move with an uncanny, trembling motion. Some are small, some large—yet all seem like living fragments of the forest itself. **Twig Blight**s and **Needle Blight**s.
- Long rest at the camp. The beginning of the journey to King’s Stand.
## Scene 2.1: Journey Through the Forest
	"You set out westward through the forest. The main road, long untouched by caravans, is covered in moss upon its stone paving, in places mingling with soil. Along the way, various birds and squirrels move about in the trees, watching you as you pass. From time to time, wild animals such as deer, boars, skunks, and badgers appear. The journey of about six hours passes without incident."
- Ask the party for their marching order.
- Ask the players if they want to do anything during the journey (e.g., gathering plants).
- **Passive Perception ≥ 15**: They notice, out of the corner of their eye, a human-sized dark silhouette watching the party from within the forest. When they turn their head, the silhouette vanishes. _(Note: This is the ghost of a former human druid who has turned into a tree within the forest.)_
## Scene 2.2: The End of the Road
	"At the end of six hours, the stone road curves southward, where a second side path cleared from the forest appears. Following this path, the Lost Mountains to the south begin to rise on the horizon, and the incline gradually levels out. By the roadside, eight or nine large tents have been set up. Right at the road’s edge, you see two men sitting on the stumps of felled trees half-buried in the soil.
	
	One is of medium height, wearing a leather headpiece adorned with tusk-shaped ornaments curling on both sides. He has on armor made of a mix of fur and leather, and at his belt hang two axes crafted of bone and bronze.
	
	The other wears no armor, his chest and stomach bare. Draped across his back is a brown bearskin, and in his hands he holds a massive greataxe. His face is almost completely hidden beneath long white-blond hair and beard; he appears to be in his fifties and is of a notably large build."
- [[Kjall, son of Kjall|Kjall, Kjall’s son]], chief of the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|Forlornwoods’ Bear Tribe]]. He stands on the main road, keeping watch together with Ulf.
	- Ulf is utterly loyal to Kjall, a man with a scruffy beard, slow speech, and a voice that seems to come from deep in his throat.
- These individuals are unfamiliar to the players; they do not resemble the people of SPQU and look foreign and unusual.
- Kjall asks the party who they are and what business they have in these lands. He attempts to extort 1 gold from the strangers.
## Scene 3: King's Stand
	"As you continue along the road, a structure appears on a slightly elevated hill. It is a church of the Eight; a bell tower rises above its dome, and many bird nests are visible on the tower. As the road levels out completely, the stone pavement beneath your feet gives way to a dirt path, and the town of King’s Stand comes fully into view before you.
	
	King’s Stand is built in a clearing created by cutting down trees within the forest. It consists of approximately 100–120 buildings; most are wooden, though a few stone structures stand out among them. Despite being located within the Forlornwoods, the small crowds walking its streets shows you a rare sight of togetherness in this far land.
	
	In the center of the town, a small manor-like building flies a flag from its rooftop. The flag is green and yellow, with an arrow symbol passing through trees at its center. This is clearly the coat of arms of the local dynasty. Around the town, a wooden defensive wall is under construction, still incomplete."
- Give the players time to explore King’s Stand.

**Rumors**
- The townsfolk speak with concern about Lord [[Sir Vincentas Orvyll|Vincentas]]’s deteriorating health.
- [[Vincas Orvyll]]’s dealings with the mountain men have caused significant unease among the people.
- Goblins are said to have advanced deep into the forest.
- The forest is reportedly "going mad," with strange noises and movements coming from within at night.
- Last July, goblins ambushed and killed 30 militiamen at the bridge that connects the Stone River.

Those in the party who notice the healers are told that Lord Vincentas has been ill for a long time. They are advised to try their luck at the Orvyll Manor.

**Quest: The Ailing Lord**  
[[Doran of Greentown]] stands watch in front of the Orvyll Manor. Adventurers passing by catch his attention. If he deems them trustworthy and competent, he will tell them of an important task.
- Lord Vincentas has been struggling with a severe illness since July. Despite all efforts, the town’s priest [[Father Quinten|Quinten]] and healer [[Esmé]] have been unable to cure him.
- Esmé has indicated that only a rare plant found deep within the forest, from a special tree, could be the cure for this illness.
- However, due to the increasing goblin threat, the town cannot send soldiers into the forest.
- Doran will offer this task to the adventurers only if he judges them to be sufficiently reliable and capable. Those who accept the quest will be generously rewarded by Lord Vincas.
- Esmé is the person with the most knowledge about the sought ingredient.
    - She notes that the “plant” is not a plant in the usual sense.
    - The cure originates from a crimson, fist-sized crystal that forms at the heart of a special tree. Its appearance resembles a human heart.
    - This crystal is a magical talisman capable of curing nearly any disease in the human body. Esmé claims she can make a medicine from this crystal to treat Lord Vincentas.
    - Esmé recalls noticing such a tree while gathering herbs in the forest in the past, but abandoned the attempt to approach it because an owlbear lived nearby.
    - The tree’s location is approximately 5–6 hours from the town and lies deep within the forest.
## Scene 4: Journey to the Magical Tree
- Ask the players, “Who walks in front, and who stays at the back?” to clarify their marching order.
- During the journey, have someone make a **DC 12 Survival** check. On a success, they notice **footprints from goblins and wolf-like creatures—larger than normal wolves—that passed through 2–3 hours earlier**.
- If they choose to follow the tracks, proceed to the **Goblin Scouts** scene.
- If they say, “We’re going straight to the tree,” start the **Lovers' Fey Tree** scene.
## Scene 5: The Lovers’ Fey Tree
	"After a five-hour journey, the familiar forest texture begins to change with its dark green, thorny leaves. Broad-leaved plants and shrubs start to appear among the usual foliage. Even tree species not commonly seen in this forest, such as oaks and poplars, begin to emerge."
- Those with **Passive Perception 15 or higher** notice shapes on the bark of certain trees.
- Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that these shapes are **symbols in the Druidic language**.
- The symbols read: **“The friendly Owlbear protects the forest.”**
 
``` 
"After a five-hour journey, the familiar forest texture begins to change. The dark green, thorny leaves of the usual foliage are now interspersed with broad-leaved plants and shrubs. Even tree species not commonly seen in this forest, such as oaks and poplars, start to appear.

Despite the lack of a clear path or trail, the forest gradually opens up as you move forward. An ancient tree comes into view; its leaves are shades of yellow and brown, and its roots protrude from the ground like veins. Fireflies hover around it, and it radiates a magical presence — this must be the tree you are seeking.

Right beside the tree, a massive creature sleeps. Its head resembles that of an owl, with a serrated, saw-like beak. Its feathers are gray like an owl’s, but its body is nearly as large and muscular as a bear’s. Countless claw marks mar the surrounding soil." 
```
- **The Owlbear**’s name is **Burbur**. The goblins drove him out of the western forest. He crossed the river and took refuge at the [[Lovers' Fey Tree]], protected by [[Typha, Friend of Forlornwoods]]. His only concern now is to keep both goblins and intruders away from the area. Those who approach the tree are first **warned**. If they do not heed the warning, he attacks. If combat ensues, the characters are pursued around the tree **until they are several hours away**, and he does not relent until the threat is gone. Burbur communicates with extended vocalizations.
- Typha is hiding behind the tree.
	- She makes her voice sound as if it comes from within the tree when speaking to those who approach.
	- She explains that this area is the grave of an ancient elven warrior.
	- She asks them to leave if they have come to cause harm; otherwise, she inquires about their purpose.
- If she trusts the players, she emerges from behind the tree.
	- With good roleplay, **no Persuasion check is needed**. Otherwise, **Persuasion DC 15** applies.
- If the players indicate they have come for the crystal living in the heart of the tree:
	- She will say she cannot give them the crystal.
	- She will point out that another [[Cursed Blight Tree|fey tree]] exists deeper in the forest.
	- This tree also contains a **heart stone**.
	- However, this tree spreads disease, forcing plants to grow aggressively with thorns and disrupting nature.
	- Typha knows the location of this tree via its roots. The tree is across from a man-made path, inside the forest, and along the river coming from the mountain.
	- If the players manage to stop this tree from spreading disease, she promises they may safely stay here under the tree’s protection whenever they wish, and she will help them with any nature-related questions. Until then, Typha does not want them around her lover's tomb.
## Scene 6: Goblin Scouts
If the players have followed the goblin tracks to this point, the goblins are unaware of the party’s approach. However, if the party makes noise while moving through the forest, the goblins notice them and set up an ambush. This encounter takes place when the party is about 4 hours away from King’s Stand.

	"Your journey brings you to a shallow stream. As you approach its bank, you notice tracks left in the wet soil. The tracks cross to the other side of the stream and continue through the dense trees toward a large rock."

**Encounter Details**
- **Goblins (4 total):**  Recently scouted King’s Stand and are now resting on their way back to camp. They rely on the fear of men and are resting without much caution.  Each has visible burn scars: some on their eyes, others on arms or necks.
- **Passive Perception:**  Any character whose Passive Perception beats the goblins’ *Stealth* roll can act during the surprise round.  
- **Stealth Rolls (advantage in forest):** 12, 18, 25, 13  
- **If the party is noisy:**
	- 2 goblins climb onto the large rock.
	- 2 hide behind trees.
	- Rock goblins gain **+2 attack bonus**.
	- All goblins behind cover (rock or trees) gain **+2 AC (half cover)**.  
- **If the party is stealthy:** Goblins are caught resting, vulnerable behind the rock.
- **Retreat:** If losing, the goblins attempt to flee northwest toward [[Burned Claws Scout Camp]].

**What the Goblins Know**  
If the characters capture or magically influence one of the goblins here, the goblin can be persuaded to share some useful information:  
- Their tribe is called the [[Burned Claws Tribe]]. Their chief’s name is [[Cannibal Brits]]. The tribe’s main stronghold is in [[Greentown]]. Brits wants to conquer King’s Stand before winter and end human dominance in the forest entirely. Brits has hobgoblin lieutenants and keeps a creature known as [[Iennos, The Shadow]] always at his side.  
- There are two separate camps in the forest. The [[Shrine of Cleansing|main camp]] is a ruined dwarven temple in the south of the forest. The [[Burned Claws Scout Camp|scout camp]] is built atop a large rocky outcrop within the woods.  
- The scout camp exists to monitor King’s Stand’s military movements. The main force, however, is gathered at the dwarven temple to the east.  
- The scout camp also serves as a supply point. Supplies and new soldiers mounted on **worgs** are sent directly from Greentown to the southern camp. The camp is surrounded by traps.  
- The scout camp currently houses 7 goblins and 1 bugbear. The bugbear’s name is **Norr**. **Norr** is one of Cannibal Brits’ lieutenants and is responsible for scouting operations and supply coordination in the forest.
