**Dangers:** 
- Mountain Man

**Goals:**
- Mountain Man: Get down into the valley to get the village under their control. Escape from the lost mountains for monster invasion.
- Goblins: Enslaved by Bugbear lieutenants of Shadar-kai.
- Shadar-kai: Capture Greenfort and use it as base to raise an army and followers. Gather essence of the alves in order to open portal to Shadowfell, as ordered by the Raven Queen.
Place Concepts:
- King's Stand: A small village, and leftover of what was once glorious Orlion House. It is of a stone watchtower, couple of small huts, and a church dedicated to the Raven. Lord Karl Orlion witnessed the might of the magic of high elves forty years ago when he was young. His home, the city of Orvyll is out of the borders for Utland, magically sealed by high elves. He was the first line of defense of the empire. Now he is lording over a humble village which its residents earn their lives by woodcutting, hunting, and small husbandry.
- The Cave of Eons: The protector children were here in this cave long time ago. In the cave there is a painting at the end of the tunnel. A figure nothing but darkness holding a sword of changing black, blue, and purple colors stabbed a figure through its heart, while holding another from its neck in the air.
- Broken Altar: An altar to a lady carved out of stone holding grains and leaves in her hand. She is All Mother, the main deity of high elves. Her temple was built here forty years ago when high elves moved out of their forests to war with humans. Now All Mother is calling for wills who will stop the corruption spreading in the forest.
- A Marble Tree: The wizard dies but cantrip remains. An owl who was once companion of a wizard is encircling around the marble tree that his body became after his burial

**Campaign Hook:** Reclaim Castle Orlyon. 
- Before it was besieged and sealed by the Elves, Castle Orlyon was one of the rare places where the roots of [[Alves]] reached and produced [[Alf Stone]]. During the _War of the Flames_, the Elves sealed off all lands touched by the roots of Alves to prevent humans from accessing this vital source of magic. Since then, Utland has lacked the resources needed to raise disciplined mages who could serve the republic in both governance and warfare. Now, Senator Praetor seeks to reclaim the Alf Stones in order to produce spell focuses, spellbooks, and tomes—hoping to elevate humanity’s arcane power. The kingdom lost the war because of the Elves’ mastery of magic, and Praetor believes regaining access to the Alf Stones is key to shifting that balance. Senator Praetor also knows that [[Ard Caëd]] and [[Dol Caëd]] are deeply entangled in their ongoing struggle against the Drow in the Endless Forest. With their attention diverted, he sees a rare opportunity to act decisively—retaking Castle Orlyon before the Elves can respond. His strategy is to present them with a _fait accompli_, and—like a good ally—offer assistance in their conflict with the Drow. Whether the Elves accept this gesture or see through the maneuver is a risk he’s willing to take. Meanwhile, he is not the only one seeking to control this ancient resource. The forces of evil in the [[Shadowfell]] have fixed their gaze on the [[Forlornwoods]], seeing it as a potential foothold for their return to the material realm. As tensions rise on all sides, the fate of Castle Orlyon—and perhaps the realm itself—hangs in the balance.
- The reason Senator Praetor chose this particular site is because the Lone Forest has become an isolated region since the war—beyond the reach of any nation's influence. Conducting operations there would draw less attention and minimize the risk of political interference.
