**Without a Sound** is a local campaign set within [[Forlornwoods]], beginning thirty years after _the War of Flames_, with [[King's Stand]] serving as the central settlement for the players. The main goal of the party is to stabilize Forlornwoods and reclaim Greenfort in order to access the [[Alf Stone|alf stone]] mine beneath the castle. However, two rival factions have also set their sights on Greenfort. One is [[House Orvyll]], now ruled by Vincas Orvyll, who believes that the key to restoring his house’s power lies in reclaiming their old settlements. The other is the [[Burned Claws Tribe]], a tribes of goblins led by a Shadar-kai who also seeks to claim [[Greenfort]] for their own. The adventurers will face complications and dark secrets that will force them to decide whom to support, whom to trust, or whether to take control of the region themselves.

### The Campaign Hook
- Reclaim Greenfort.
### The Six Truths
<hr style="margin: 0;">

- Greenfort was besieged by the Elven Coalition during _the War of Flames_. Now, it is sealed by [[Ard Caëd]] with magic, and no citizen of [[The Senate and People of Utland|SPQU]] is allowed to enter.
- Forlornwoods is the fief of House Orvyll. House Orvyll has been in decline since its central settlements were destroyed during the war. Forlornwoods is becoming increasingly dangerous and isolated.
- The western half of Forlornwoods, including [[Greentown]] and the rest of House Orvyll’s settlements, was destroyed. The banished folk of [[Greentown]] resettled in [[King's Stand]], the new seat of House Orvyll.
- The dwarves of [[Lost Mountains]] abandoned Forlornwoods after losing their mountain to the armies of dark forces that awoke beneath it when the [[Alves|Alf]] of Veretia was burned.
- Graves of many elves are scattered throughout Forlornwoods from the war. Some claim that ghosts haunt the forest.
- Some influential people within the republic think arcane magic is the only way for Utland to unite all humanity under one banner, and alf stones are a necessity for that.
