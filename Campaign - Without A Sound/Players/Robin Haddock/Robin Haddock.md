**Robin** was the child of **Haddock** and **Sialia**, born in 834 AA to the [[Saltuarius Tribe]]. Robin’s birth was marred by tragedy: Sialia died in childbirth, a common misfortune among their nomadic hunter-gatherer people. Robin was born frail — the result of poor luck, complications, and hereditary weakness — and often fell ill.

[[Sialis]], Robin’s aunt, stepped in to help Haddock raise the child. As Robin grew to resemble her late sister, Sialis became deeply attached. But Robin’s frailty soon made her a burden on the tribe: unable to safely forage or hunt, she understood the skills but could not consistently contribute. Often she was left behind in camp while the rest of the Saltuarius worked to cover the resource gap.

At age five, Robin fell gravely ill during the fall migration. Normally the Saltuarius relied on their own herbal remedies or the aid of local healers, but in emergencies they sought help from church physicians in the [[The Senate and People of Utland|SPQU]]. It was such healers who saved Robin’s life. Her long recovery made Sialis realize their situation could not last. The following spring, Sialis joined the [[King's Stand]] militia, hoping to rise within militia through her scouting skills. This gave her a steady income to support Robin and, in her mind, repaid the city that had saved her niece.

Robin, meanwhile, traveled with the tribe but was too weak to explore freely. She saw the world through a narrow keyhole: the past was safer than the present, so she poured her curiosity into studying natural history, ancient graves, and local lore, including tales of elven ghosts. Within her limited safe radius, she absorbed everything she could and practiced hunting skills obsessively, hoping someday to make Sialis proud. When her aunt visited between postings, she cared for Robin and told her stories of the wider world.

By nineteen, Robin’s health improved enough for her to join the hunts. That autumn she even completed the migration to [[Rosefall]] without falling ill. But that winter, she saw how much Sialis had changed. Her aunt now spoke with the values of the SPQU: hierarchy among peoples, domination over nature, and hunting for sport. Over subsequent visits, some Saltuarius began adopting these views, which Robin could not understand.

At twenty, Robin became a full contributor to the tribe and expected her aunt to return. Instead, Sialis — now firmly loyal to [[House Orvyll]] — urged the Saltuarius to join the militia. She argued they could use their hunting skills to serve Utland and its people rather than scrape by as foragers. She spoke of the crimes committed by the elven coalition in their war against House Orvyll—the destruction of forests, the loss of human lives, and the political decision to reject elven terms of peace by crossing into the western [[Forlornwoods]].

Robin begged her aunt to come back, but Sialis refused, saying her duty was with House Orvyll now that Robin could hunt on her own. For two years this pattern repeated: Sialis visiting, pressuring the Saltuarius to enlist. By the time Robin was twenty-three, Sialis was a soldier in truth. She became convinced that Ard Caed’s sealing of Greenfort held great purpose, and that something within was key to reject elven dominance and violance.

In the summer of 857 AA, Lord Vincentas fell ill. Many of the Saltuarius, already swayed by Sialis, joined the militia. The tribe became too shorthanded for long hunts and found themselves trapped near King’s Stand. Forced into overhunting, they violated their own traditions and edged toward a sedentary life.

Robin blamed herself, believing that Sialis had first enlisted to support her during her childhood sickness. When she tried to reason with her aunt or the defectors, they dismissed her — she had been too sheltered, too frail, too late to prove her worth.

So Robin chose another path. She set out alone to save her people and to bring Sialis back to their values, or, if she could not, to stop her. Her goals were clear:
- To prove her knowledge of the world through action and experience.
- To study both past and present — from the War of Flames to the Alf Trees — and gather truths that might sway her aunt.
- To reach Greenfort before [[House Orvyll]], uncover its secrets, and use that discovery either to redeem Sialis… or to stand against her.
