**Cran Nolast** was the firstborn son of [[Sir Edwart Nolast]], born in 831 AA to [[House Nolast]]. He and his sister [[Helen Nolast]] were orphaned at an early age after Sir Edwart defied the orders of King [[Chronology of Utland#^GalvynII|Galvyn II von Ewfai]] to raze the settlements and destroy the [[Alves|Alf Tree]] in [[Veretia]]. For this disobedience, his father was executed by royal decree, and House Nolast was branded traitors.

When the remnants of their house received word of the execution, [[Barkenburgh Castle]] came under siege. All Cran and Helen could do was flee, escaping with their lives. Hiding along roads, sneaking rides on farmer’s carts, and avoiding patrols, the siblings eventually reached [[Fascesstadt]], where they were left to fend for themselves in the city’s back alleys.

On the very day they fled, Cran began to hear voices pounding in his head — voices that whispered of an impending apocalypse and his role in preventing it. At first he dismissed them as nonsense, but they plagued him with sleepless nights in childhood and nightmares as he grew older. No healer could cure the voices, and few people cared to try. His isolation deepened; while Helen somehow managed to scrape together enough coins to feed them both, Cran was often left alone. In those times, hunger and desperation drove him to steal.

Despite his poor social skills — worsened by a reputation as “mad” — Cran found that being overlooked made it easier to pickpocket and pilfer from merchants. His petty theft eventually drew the attention of [[The Eyers|the Eyers]], one of Fascesstadt’s criminal networks. Caught stealing from them, he expected harsh punishment. Instead, their leader, [[Norpus]], saw potential and recruited him. Under the Eyers, Cran honed his talents, turning from a desperate street thief into a disciplined criminal.

Years later, Helen resolved to leave Fascesstadt, determined to restore their fallen house’s reputation. She brought Cran with her into the [[Forlornwoods]], hoping to carve out a name for themselves. By chance, her plan aligned with a mission Cran had already been given by the Eyers: to open a path for [[House Orvyll]] to reclaim [[Greenfort]].
