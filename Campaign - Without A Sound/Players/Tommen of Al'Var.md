**Tommen of Al'Var** was the son of **Vaeri** and [[Edelhard of Al'var]], born in 833 AA to an elven mother and a human father. He recalls them living together only faintly, from when he was a toddler. What little he knows of that time was pressed out of his father, who seemed eager to forget it ever happened. Through persistence and his own research, Tommen pieced together that their home had not been in [[The Senate and People of Utland|SPQU]], but in a settlement called [[Al'Var]] — a town beyond the southern province of SPQU, inhabited largely by humans and half-elves.

What he remembers most clearly, however, was the long journey he took with his father that ended in [[Ewyngard]]. There, his father introduced him to his new family, [[The Church of The Eight|the Church of the Eight]].

Within a year of their arrival, Tommen was given the rank of _Puer Oblatus_ and began his education in [[Basilica Arbitria]]. Eager to belong, he wore his hair as long as permitted to conceal the points of his ears, kept his head low, and threw himself into his duties in the hope of earning his father’s approval.

By his early teens, Tommen had entered the ranks of the _Scholasticus_. He felt drawn to the study of church law and began to believe he was called to serve in the clergy as his father had before him, his pagan elven mother be damned. Yet during those years he also discovered a troubling truth: he possessed a strange aptitude for holy magic. Fearing suspicion, he buried the knowledge deep, refusing to dwell on it lest it bring him trouble.

When he was appointed a *Tonsured Cleric*, Tommen devoted himself further to ritual work and study. His father, a priest of [[The Fighter|the Fighter]], had long hoped his son would follow in his path, securing their place in the Fighter’s clergy and erasing the stain of **Vaeri**’s pagan heritage. Tommen, eager for his father’s respect and secretly hoping faith in the Fighter might reveal the purpose of his hidden magic, sought entry into the Minor Order dedicated to the Fighter.

With persistence — and no small help from his father’s influence — he gained entry. In Ewyngard, he served under priests of the Fighter, learning the rituals and philosophy of _the Protector_. He assisted in preparing materials for blessings of weapons, gathering pre-conflict confessions, and tending to the sick and wounded. He studied basic combat, weapon care, and armor maintenance. Though most often placed among the healers, he longed to one day stand among those who fought to protect others in the Fighter’s name.

Rising in time to the title of *Subdeacon*, Tommen took on greater responsibilities in the sect. His life was full of duty until one Wednesday morning, when a Scholasticus came to him with grim news: his father had passed in his sleep. The death struck him as sudden, for his father had seemed in good health and kept himself busy with his work. Without his father’s protection, Tommen quickly found himself isolated by those he had thought friends.

Desperate to prove his worth, he sought any chance to demonstrate his faith. Opportunity came in the form of an appointment (or an exile) to [[King's Stand]] as the new *Subdeacon*, by decree of The Most Reverend [[Gwyn von Omond]], Archbishop of [[Mirna]]. For the first time since his youth, Tommen left Ewyngard. Whatever awaited him, he embraced the chance — both to serve his Church and to restore honor to his father’s name, and his own.
