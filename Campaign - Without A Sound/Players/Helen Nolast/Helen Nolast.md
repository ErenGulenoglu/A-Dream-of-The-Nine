**Helen Nolast** was the firstborn daughter of [[Sir Malekith Nolast]] and **Celeste Nolast**, born in 827 AA to [[House Nolast]]. She and his brother [[Cran Nolast]] were orphaned at an early age after their father defied the orders of King [[Chronology of Utland#^GalvynII|Galvyn II von Ewfai]] to raze the settlements and destroy the [[Alves|Alf Tree]] in [[Veretia]]. For this disobedience, his father was executed by royal decree, and House Nolast was branded traitors.

When word of the execution reached their household, [[Barkenburgh Castle]] — the Nolast family seat — came under siege. All Helen and Cran could do was flee, escaping with their lives. Hiding along roads, sneaking rides on farmer’s carts, and avoiding patrols, the siblings eventually reached [[Fascesstadt]], where they were left to fend for themselves in the city’s back alleys.

After her father’s death, Helen took it upon herself to restore House Nolast to its former glory. In her eyes, the burden of rebuilding fell to her, as her brother Cran was unfit to lead due to his bouts of madness. Yet every attempt she made was met with ridicule — no one believed two destitute orphans could carry the weight of nobility.

Poverty and desperation eventually drove Helen into the fighting pits. There she earned a wage by pitting her strength against criminals and outcasts, which she justified as aligning with House Nolast’s values of justice: beating down villains while earning coin. Her physical prowess proved invaluable, allowing her to provide food and shelter for herself and Cran.

Her relationship with her brother remained strained. She felt burdened by the duty of preserving their name, while Cran seemed to enjoy the freedom of ignoring it. Still, when the chance came to journey to [[Greenfort]], Helen chose to follow him. She refused to leave Cran alone, and she believed that taking Greenfort could be the opportunity they needed to reclaim some measure of credibility for their house.
