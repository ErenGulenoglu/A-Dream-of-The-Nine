_Wondrous item_

This weathered journal is bound in dark wood cover. Though it appears to be the diary of a long-dead rogue, it is, in truth, a sealed fragment of that rogue’s memory—specifically, a piece of Eldon of Greentown, spymaster of House Orvyll.

The diary is written entirely in Thieves’ Cant. Only those who understand the code may comprehend its contents.

**Lore:**  
Eldon’s true identity was known only to Lord Vincentas Orvyll, head of House Orvyll. Culann served as the House’s spymaster and protector, charged with defending against infiltration and espionage. His most grievous task, however, was to assassinate the children of King Galvynn II, on the orders of his liege.

Haunted by guilt, Eldon concealed his memories within this diary and took his own life. The pages are layered with secrets, and a hidden spell scroll lies encoded within them.

***Chapter I – New Faces, Old Regrets***

	“I see that a scoundrel has laid hands and eyes upon my diary, knowing Thieves' Cant. If you seek glory or adventure, close this book now, stranger. My life offers neither. I am Eldon of Greentown, most loyal assassin and servant of House Orvyll. I protected Lord Vincentas and his descendants from spies, assassins, and betrayal. I killed for them. But I never expected my own death would come by my own hand. Even in vile acts, I remained loyal—yes, even in the burning of the Alf Tree of Veretia.”

***Chapter II – The End of the World, The End of the Kingdom***

	“When the Alf Tree burned, Lord Vincentas returned to Forlornwoods. He saw the madness in King Galvynn II, and foresaw his death against the elves. He gave me one final task: go to Ewyngard as a trusted envoy, and kill the king’s children to plunge the realm into a succession crisis. I obeyed. I learned the guards’ patterns, studied the castle’s rhythms. Then the king died in battle. Chaos reigned. That night, I wore the face of a slain guard and entered the children's chambers. I left no trace. I have killed enemies of the House before—but this time, I buried my blade in shame. I hid it in the bell of the Church of the Raven. Only the gods may judge me.”

***Chapter III – The End?***

	When I returned to Forlornwoods, I witnessed what _the War of the Flames_ had done to House Orvyll. Greenfort was sealed away by a magical barrier, and Greentown was destroyed—reduced to ashes. Lord Vincentas’ son, Valdas Orvyll, and his wife Alma Orvyll, died beneath a collapsed tower in Greenfort. I suppose it was the muse of the gods: the one who ordered the death of another’s children lost his own. I found Lord Vincentas in King’s Stand, a shade of his former self. The town was crowded with refugees from Greentown. There was not enough food. He told me the suffering was temporary, and gave me a spell scroll to use in the future—to reclaim Greenfort and rebuild. He said the _alf stones_ were the only path to power in this new era of humanity—the same arcane force the elves used to bring destruction. This family gave me everything in life. But seeing them brought so low… was it worth it? The people of Greentown, once mighty and prosperous, now flee to other corners of Utland. The time of House Orvyll has passed. And my time has come to an end as well. What I deserve is a rope and a tree.
