Dex and Rex were twin brothers, born of a human mother and a half-elf father. Among their three older siblings, only Dex and Rex bore the pointed ears of elven heritage — a trait that marked them as different in the eyes of their village.

Because of this, the villagers shunned them. At the age of ten, they left their home behind.

In time, they encountered an elf who recognized their potential for magic. The elf brought them to a school of magic in [[White Meadow]], where they studied for ten years. Both proved talented in theory and quick to learn. They dreamed of becoming great wizards.

At school, they became close friends with another student named Elias. The three of them grew inseparable over time. During this period, Dex stole several [[Alf Stone|alf stones]] from their teachers and gave them to Elias to use in secret experiments. Together, they began to study the ancient magical energy contained within the stones. Elias discovered that this energy could be used to open portals to other realms.

During one of their experiments, something went horribly wrong. The portal energy spiraled out of control, and Rex was gravely injured. Shaken by what had happened—and afraid of the consequences—they decided to flee the school. The three escaped together, taking with them their teacher’s spellbook and staff. They believed that by leaving the school and facing the world, they would grow stronger and become master wizards more quickly.

But eventually, conflict arose between them. Dex was at fault. Elias, who had become more skilled by then, fought with him. During the fight, Rex died protecting Dex. After that, Elias disappeared, taking the stolen spellbook and staff with him.

Dex, consumed by regret, took Rex’s body and isolated himself in a cabin. He tried every method he could to bring Rex back to life, but failed. In time, he swore never to cast magic again. He broke his arcane focus and quarterstaff, though he continued reading books in hopes of finding a way.

He remained in the forest, alone, for twenty-five years.

At the age of forty-five, he realized there might still be a way to bring Rex back by using alf stones. But first, he would need to gain strength and gather great wealth. From that day forward, his purpose was clear: to find a way to cast that spell and bring his twin brother back to life.

He knew that the Elven Coalition sealed Greenfort, a place now isolated and no one entered. Claiming the fort and alf stone mine under it would certainly turn eyes of most influential people of Somnium on him, a hope which he might utilize it to bring his brother back.
