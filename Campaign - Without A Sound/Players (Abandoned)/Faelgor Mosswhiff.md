Faelgor was one of the rare few among the half-elves of [[Ard Caëd]] who ventured beyond the borders of their ancient woodland at a young age. While most of his kin remained deep in their groves and sacred circles, Faelgor wandered the cities of men, and there he encountered a strange indulgence.

It was called _Grimburn_ — a heavy dwarven tobacco distilled from subterranean mushrooms. At first, he used it sparingly, in meditation. But over time, the ritual gave way to habit, and habit to dependence. In later years, he was seldom seen without a hand-rolled cigarette, often trailing smoke, his eyes half-lidded beneath drifting thoughts.

One night, he dreamt — not of [[The All-Mother|the All-Mother]], as druids often did — but of a wolf who spoke in her voice. The creature whispered of a world crying out in pain, and of a deeper truth: that real balance lay not in good or evil, order or chaos, but in **free will** alone.

From that moment on, Faelgor began to question the traditional elven teachings and the old rites he had once upheld without doubt. Though still a druid, he believed that to protect nature was not to follow rigid dogma, but to move with the current of its voice — wild, shifting, and alive.

Those who traveled with him noted his odd rituals. He often sniffed the earth and claimed to smell unrest. At times when others offered prayers, he would simply light a cigarette, exhale deeply, and send his intent skyward in smoke. More than once, he was heard muttering, _“Even the All-Mother must breathe, eh?”_ before flicking ash into the wind.

Some mocked him. Others called him mad. But those who walked beside him in wild places knew this much: the land listened to Faelgor — and sometimes, whispered back.
