Jeremus was born in an unremarkable, unnamed village in northern Utland. His childhood was spent in quiet communion with nature.

During a harvest rite, as he prayed and laid his hand upon an apple tree, its branches turned green and its fruits ripened. Archbishop Heracles, who happened to be traveling from village to village to bless the harvests, witnessed the event. He took it as a sign that Jeremus had been chosen by [[The All-Mother|the All-Mother]]. In private, the Archbishop advised the boy to keep his gifts hidden from the eyes of others.

In time, Jeremus joined the traveling clerics and was taught the ways of herbalism, healing, and sanctity.

After one of the Alf trees burned, he left the group and journeyed alone into the forests of Utland, seeking to restore the balance of Somnium.

Years later, his path crossed once again with Archbishop Heracles, who warned him that a darkness was gathering in the [[Forlornwoods]]—and that Jeremus’s blessing was needed there. With an ordination ritual, he raised him to the rank of **Minor Orders**, officially making him a cleric of the All-Mother.

As a member of the clergy, he walked the wild roads, he carried saplings and herbs in his pack. He offered healing to villages and blessed births along the way.

Jeremus envisioned a future Utland where elves and humans, united in reverence for the All-Mother, could live in harmony.

He placed no trust in the SPQU nobles and regarded House Ros with particular hostility.
