Iennos was a **shadow dancer** Shadar-kai of neutral evil inclination, wholly devoted to the service of the Raven Queen. He hailed from the realm of the [[Shadowfell]], where he spent the entirety of his life, far removed from the light of the [[Alves]].

By his Queen’s will, a duty was laid upon him: to unseal a passage betwixt the realms through the forsaken [[Alf Stone|alf stone]] mine beneath [[Greenfort]], nestled in the heart of the [[Forlornwoods]]. This endeavor was to prepare a foothold for the Raven Queen, who had turned her gaze upon Somnium. It was paramount that this undertaking remain veiled from prying eyes, accomplished through means native to the material plane.

In pursuit of this aim, ere he set forth for the Forlornwoods, Iennos did unite the [[Burned Claws Tribe]] in the [[Giant Foothills]] beneath the command of one called [[Cannibal Brits]]. The goblin chieftain was swayed to Iennos’ cause in the year 855 AA. Within the tribe, Iennos held the guise of counsellor and companion to Cannibal Brits, though those who glimpsed the countenance beneath his hood oft likened him to the elves—and such comparisons stirred unease and suspicion.

In the winter of 857 AA, he led the tribe into the Forlornwoods.

Iennos bore no hair upon his head, his skin a corpse-like ashen hue. He draped himself in a black, tattered robe, beneath which he concealed his spiked chain weapons. His voice emerged from his mouth like a maelstrom's breath. He knew neither joy nor mirth, and yet he seemed in no haste to return to the Shadowfell. Death held no terror for him; he welcomed its approach, certain that his Queen would restore him in time. Should a tragedy serve to please her, he would enact it with solemn duty and without hesitation.
