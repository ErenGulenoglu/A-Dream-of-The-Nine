**Sialis** was a Chaotic Neutral aligned human **scout** in her forties, the sister of **Sialia**—[[Robin Haddock]]'s mother—who died during childbirth. She was a member of the [[Saltuarius Tribe]], and in 839 AA she joined the [[King's Stand]] militia, hoping to rise through her scouting skills. This gave her a steady income to support Robin.

Over the years, Sialis witnessed strange creatures lurking in the forest that had not been part of the [[Forlornwoods]] before, as well as small goblin packs crossing the [[Lost Mountains]] from the [[Giant Foothills]]. These events changed Sialis’ views on the ways of her tribe and made her decide to remain in the King’s Stand militia to protect both the forest and her tribe’s values—even if this meant disobeying traditions and growing distant from Robin. During this time, she urged her tribe to join the King’s Stand militia, but her ideas of centralizing their habitation area clashed with the Saltuarius’ migratory traditions.

Her views sharpened after a party of thirty militia were sent by [[Sir Vincentas Orvyll]] to wipe out a large goblin camp. When the group did not return, Sialis went out to scout for them and found their bodies looted and laid bare on the bridge across the _Rock River_, connecting the western and eastern Forlornwoods. From that day, she resolved to fight against anything in the forest that threatened life, nature, and [[House Orvyll]] itself.

Once, she had believed the elves were righteous in punishing Utland for burning the [[Alves|Alf]] of [[Veretia]]. But after witnessing the consequences of pacifying the [[The Senate and People of Utland|SPQU]] to the point of desperation—and recalling the destruction their arcane wars had brought—she now believes that if the SPQU does not act against them, far worse dangers await life in the Land of the Awakened.
