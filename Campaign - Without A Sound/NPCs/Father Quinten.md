**Quinten of [[Purpleberry]]** was a Lawful Good **priest** who served the town of [[King's Stand]] after 856 AA. A deacon of [[The Raven|the Raven]] and a humble servant of [[The Church of The Eight|the Church]], Quinten had originally been assigned to the town as a temporary attendant following the death of Father Marlon. Though only twenty-four, he was addressed as "Father" by the townsfolk out of respect for his piety and composure.

He was a lean young man with black hair and haunting yellow eyes. A faded claw mark stretched across his face—a relic of his childhood. His eyes, once dark, had turned pale yellow in the wake of a sickness that afflicted him at the age of ten. On a fevered night, he claimed to hear voices in the shadows, and to feel a presence using his own mouth to speak words he could not understand. In his terror, he clawed at his own face, attempting to expel whatever had taken hold of him.

He was saved by a local priest of [[The Lightkeeper|the Lightkeeper]], who later convinced his family to send him into the service of the Church. Thus began his education in the great cathedral of [[Rosefall]], where he eventually found himself drawn to the teachings of the Raven. To Quinten, wisdom and knowledge were not only sacred but necessary—tools to protect free will and to uncover the nature of what had once spoken through him.

When word reached Rosefall of Father Marlon’s death, Quinten volunteered to take his place in King’s Stand. He was drawn not only by duty, but by word of a dwarven-made shrine—[[Shrine of Cleansing]]— to [[The Artisan|the Artisan]], a place where dwarven craftsmen laid in silence for a day and night to cleanse their souls before beginning their masterworks. He believed such sacred ground might help quiet the thing that still lingered within him.

Quinten kept candles burning in the church at all hours and carried several on his person, warding against the darkness he still heard whispering in the shadows. Though calm and kind in appearance, he bore a quiet desperation. He feared not death, but losing control of his voice again—and becoming a vessel for something not of this world.
