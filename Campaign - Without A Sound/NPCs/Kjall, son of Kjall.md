**Kjall, son of Kjall** was a Neutral **berserker** who led the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|Tribe of the Bear]]. Chief Kjall was known as a fair man and as strong as a bear, having slain a brown bear when he was but sixteen. He stood two meters tall, a bulky and muscular man with wild blond hair and a beard, ever clad in his bear pelt. He could outdrink any man at the table. His demeanor was high-spirited; he laughed the loudest and roared the fiercest war cries.

His reputation among his people, however, soured after he shook hands with [[Lord Vincas Orvyll]]. To some, he came to be seen as a weakened old man, soon to be challenged by a greater and younger warrior who would claim the title of chief.

Kjall knew all of this. He was aware that he was past his prime, having reached the age of fifty when the clansmen clashed with a party of the [[Burned Claws Tribe]]. He was wounded in the fighting, and his prowess in battle was never the same thereafter. He knew well how forging an alliance would be perceived by his kin, yet he also knew that rejecting the hand of the lord would mean death for his people. Goblins had begun to spread through the forest, cutting off the tribe’s hunting paths with each passing day.

Kjall sought to eradicate the goblins from Forlornwoods and to secure a lasting alliance with [[House Orvyll]] for the future of his people. He did his best to keep his warriors under control when they entered King’s Stand, even as tensions rose with the townsfolk.
