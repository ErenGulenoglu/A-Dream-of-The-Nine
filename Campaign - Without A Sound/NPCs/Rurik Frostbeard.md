**Rurik Frostbeard** (LG **bandit** with Warhammer) was an old dwarf (around 250 years old), dark-bearded dwarven innkeeper who often reminisced about his days in [[Greentown]], where he once managed a much larger inn that welcomed travelers, merchants, and wanderers in abundance. He was not patient with the comings and goings of life, and would often express his restlessness by tapping his fingers on the bar counter whenever his hands were empty.

Rurik had a brother named Bain. Both were among those banished from Greentown after _the War of Flames_. They brewed their own dwarven ale, the famed **Frostbeard Ale**. Though Rurik had not been within the [[Lost Mountains]] during the war, he spoke grimly of the moment he knew his kin’s doom had begun—when the [[Alves|Alf]] of Veretia were burned and ancient powers beneath the mountains were awakened.

Rurik harbored deep resentment toward [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|the Bear Tribe]] men brought into King’s Stand by [[Lord Vincas Orvyll]]. The dwarves of the Lost Mountains had long viewed those tribes as invaders, having clashed with them countless times over territory and ancestral holds. Though he kept his voice low within the inn, Rurik made no secret of his disdain—he wanted them gone from the town.

Rurik and Bain were short-fused, even by dwarven standards. Even the smallest provocations could drive them to draw blood.
