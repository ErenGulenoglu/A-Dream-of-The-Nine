**Esmé** was a Neutral Evil **night hag** fiend who disguises herself among the folk of King’s Stand as an apothecarist. She was a worshipper of **Orpharx** and is approximately 200 to 250 years old. Outwardly, Esmé appeared to be a self-confident and skilled woman, but this demeanor concealed her true motives. She appeared to be in her early thirties—a woman with dark wavy hair, dark eyes accented by dark makeup, and fair skin. Esmé was a skilled healer and alchemist, adept at brewing potions and solutions. She was also a talented painter, crafting her own pigments through alchemical methods.

When she was fourteen, Esmé was raped by the men of her local lord. When she reported what had happened to the authorities, they did nothing to punish the aristocrat’s men. To take revenge, Esmé answered the call of powers she heard in the flames and killed all who had wronged her. Her motivation is to become the ruler of a powerful noble house, creating a land of prosperity and peace while repaying her debts to the voices she heard in the flames.

Esmé was a witch with the ambition to rule. She waited for years to see her investments in [[House Orvyll]] bear fruit, but after _the War of Flames_ diminished the house’s power, she once again seek to take matters into her own hands. Her goal is to lift the house from despair and use its strength to prepare the path for the invasion of Somnium.

She was the wife of [[House Orvyll#^VincasOrvyll|Lord Vincas Orvyll]], the founder of House Orvyll. After his death in 770 AA, she faked her own death shortly thereafter. She arrived in King’s Stand in 855 AA, having departed to the inner Utland following her disappearance. Now, she seeks to charm the mind of young Lord Vincas, to marry him and rule [[Forlornwoods]] by pulling his strings.

In 855 AA, [[Lord Vincas Orvyll]], who had assumed the authority of his grandfather, became fond of Esmé and entered into a secret relationship with her. Esmé ensnared his mind by inducing horrific dreams, gradually weaving him into becoming a warlock and making a pact with Orpharx without his knowledge.

Esmé loved to take indirect routes to her goals, and instead of eliminating obstacles when she has the advantage, she makes greedy moves to cause her obstacles to eliminate each other.

In addition to her spell list, Esmé knows:
- Cure Wounds (1st-level spell slot)
- Lesser Restoration (2nd-level spell slot)

In addition, she carries the following items:
- Potion of Invisibility
