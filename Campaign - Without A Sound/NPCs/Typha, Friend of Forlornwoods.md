**Typha** was a neutral aligned **dryad** bound to the [[Lovers' Fey Tree]] in [[Forlornwoods]]â€”the grave of her fallen lover. Though she wandered the lands surrounding the tree, it remained her home and tether to the mortal world. Among the woodland folk, she was known and accepted as a soul of nature.

Her lover had been an elf who perished during _the Era of the Moon_, slain while fighting against *Followers of The Ninth*. His absence in the Feywild brought her great grief. In mourning, she descended into the material plane and bound herself to his grave.

Typha devoted herself to protecting the sacred tree. She obscured the paths that led to it, marking trees with hidden druidic signs to ward off intruders. She was a friend to all things wild, able to speak with beasts and plants alike. Her closest companion was an owlbear named Burbur, with whom she lived near the tree.

She was shy, friendly, melancholic, and fiercely protective. Her voice was a whisper to those she chose to speak with. She is timid. She kept her physical distance to those she could not fully trust.
