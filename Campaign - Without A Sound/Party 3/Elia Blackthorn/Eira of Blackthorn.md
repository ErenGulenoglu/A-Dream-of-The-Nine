**Eira** was the daughter of **Tanad** and **Marla**, born in 836 AA in [[Blackthorn Town]]. From a young age, she learned the nature of death, helping her family maintain the town’s cemetery and assisting the local church in organizing funerals. By the age of fourteen, she spent most of her days making bodies presentable for viewing, only to bury her work and watch it rot beneath the soil — all while the living around her endured poverty. The waste of valuables on the dead gnawed at her, and at night she would return to the cemetery to relieve the deceased of their burdens.

After about a year, her grave-robbing habits caught up with her. One night, the drunken burgomaster of Blackthorn came to the cemetery to visit his daughter’s grave. There, Eira was discovered — but not caught. In the chaos that followed, she shoved the man into the open grave she had dug, slipping away as his curses echoed through the night and roused the entire town.

With no path back, Eira abandoned Blackthorn and traveled toward the northeastern [[Riverlands]]. There, she became involved in smuggling goods from [[Fascesstadt]] across the borders of the Riverlands and [[Patria]], falling in with a voyager bandit group known as the [[Coppersmiths]]. They controlled the smuggling operations along the [[Copper River]] north of Fascesstadt, and Eira first encountered them while trying to sell valuables taken from graves. Through the Coppersmiths, she learned the art of roguery.

During these years, Eira came to understand that the realm’s cutthroats held every corner, controlling every coin that flowed across sea, river, and road. It was also during this time that the nightmares began — visions of a strange castle haunting her sleep. As the months passed, the dreams grew unbearable, driving her to search for answers. The castle she saw was human-made yet swallowed by forest: tall but broken, its scorched stones standing amid mountains devoid of dwarves.

Her search led her back to Fascesstadt, where she learned the castle’s name — [[Greentown]], the former seat of [[House Orvyll]], fallen from grace after the _War of Flames_. She discovered that the surrounding forest had become isolated when trade routes shifted after the war, leaving elven graves scattered and unprotected. As she learned more of Greenfort, the lure of profit from forgotten elven tombs took root — even as the mystery haunting her dreams refused to loosen its grip.

At last, Eira set her course for the [[Forlornwoods]], a journey of five months from Fascesstadt. After weeks on the road, she entered the forest and followed the main path toward [[King's Stand]], the seat of House Orvyll. There, she heard voices drifting from the trees. Hoping to find others who might guide her to the nearest settlement, she approached — and instead walked into a bloodbath.

Hordes of human-like creatures, their bodies covered in tree bark and thorns, tore through the woods, slaughtering all they encountered and soaking themselves in the blood of the dead. With nothing but instinct to guide her, Eira fled into the forest, running blindly and never daring to look back.
