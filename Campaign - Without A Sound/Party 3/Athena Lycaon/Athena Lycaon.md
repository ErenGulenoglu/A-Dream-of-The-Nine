**Athena Lycaon** was the daughter of **Lycaon Arcadia** and **Metis Tethys**, born in 832 AA as a member of the [[Saltuarius Tribe]]. She remembers her family being attacked in a raid by orcs when she was six. They had set up camp at night to teach the children how to hunt and forage by moonlight during their spring migration north.

The orcs struck without warning. As leaders of the _Canis_ group and members of the _Cervidae_, her mother and father fought to defend the children alongside **Nyctimus**, her older brother. They held off the attackers long enough for the others to escape. Metis was cut down protecting them; Athena and Nyctimus crawled out from under her body and ran, dodging around their father, who fought on and shouted for them to flee. Athena made it back to the main camp, but her brother never returned. The group found her parents’ bodies and searched for Nyctimus but could not find him. Eventually, they were forced to move on — the brutal fairness of nature.

Athena, only six, was angry and grief-stricken. She blamed herself for being too weak to protect her family and came to despise both the green folk who had killed her parents and those who ran instead of fighting — because she believed that was what she had done.

By thirteen, she wanted to join the _Cervidae_ as a protector, but her temper made her a poor forager. All she cared about was proving she was strong enough to protect others. Her fighting spirit made her well suited to the _Canid_ group, like her father, but her rage and lack of restraint often endangered her companions. Believing that balance in nature was something to be fought for, she became too aggressive in combat and was eventually left behind to guard the camp while others joined great hunts.

It was then that she grew close to [[Robin Haddock]], finding purpose in protecting those who could not hunt. When orcs or goblins attacked, Athena at first refused to kill them, demanding instead that they tell her if they had seen her brother.

In her eighteenth year, she came under the influence of [[Sialis]] — Robin’s aunt. Sialis had grown disillusioned with the tribe’s constant migration and had joined the [[King's Stand]] militia years before, seeking to defend both the forest and their way of life. Her experiences with the growing dangers in the [[Forlornwoods]] — strange beasts, goblin incursions from the [[Lost Mountains]], and the failure of [[House Orvyll]]’s soldiers at the _Rock River_ bridge — had hardened her views.

Sialis preached that survival came from strength and decisive action, not restraint. Her words resonated with Athena, who longed to prove herself as a warrior. She sought to join the militia under Sialis’s guidance, but her volatility and lack of discipline led others to caution against it.

Athena remained in her role as a guardian, teaching the younger children how to fight and defend themselves. As Robin’s health improved and others took on the task of protecting the camp, Athena began venturing into the woods alone — seeking out danger, both to vent her frustration at being left behind and in the hope of finding her brother.

Four days after Robin and her party departed on a scouting mission, Sialis invited Athena to join an escort mission to north of the [[Forlornwoods]] to secure the passage of the remaining members of the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|Tribe of the Bear]]. Refusing to be left behind again, Athena followed her — first to help complete the mission, and then to pursue her own: to find Robin and Nyctimus, and to finally prove herself as a true protector of her tribe.
