**Marsh** was a bastard-born tiefling, born in 839 AA in [[Fascesstadt]] to a human father and a tiefling prostitute mother, **Macha**. He learned the meaning of independence at a very young age. His earliest years were spent in the brothel’s attic, until the day his father returned — striking Macha down before turning his blade on his son. Escaping with nothing but the clothes on his back, Marsh fled into the streets, lying and stealing to survive.

By the age of nine, he was already being used for odd jobs — running messages, keeping watch, and doing whatever small tasks would earn him a meal.

When he was fourteen, Marsh had come to understand the inner workings and back alleys of his world. One day, he stumbled across [[The Traveler’s Lantern]], a small tavern tucked away on a quiet corner. There, an older half-elven man named **[[Leman of Al’Var]]** played the lyre while his daughter, **Linda**, sang for the tavern’s patrons.

Soon, Marsh began to linger near the entrance, listening to their music and quietly humming along beneath his breath, slipping away before anyone noticed — or so he thought. One evening, Linda spotted him and approached with her father. His tiefling heritage caught their interest, and before long, Marsh found himself spending time with them outside their performance hours. It was [[Linda of Al'var|Linda]] who first taught him to sing, and her father who taught him to play the lyre.

He knew the risks of their friendship, but emboldened by youth and a budding love for Linda, he spent more and more time at the tavern. He knew little of Leman’s dealings — only that the men who came and went from the tavern’s back room were dangerous. Toward the end of his fourth year under their tutelage, Leman entrusted Marsh with his lyre, asking him to keep it hidden for a few days while he and his daughter left the city on business. Marsh, proud of his mentor’s trust, happily agreed.

On the day of his eighteenth birthday, the two were scheduled to return. Marsh went to the tavern, eager to return the lyre — and to confess his feelings to Linda. Instead, he found a crowd gathered at the city’s center. There, upon the gallows, hung his mentor and his daughter — Linda executed under the accusation of illegally practicing arcane against the decree of [[The Senate|the Senate of SPQU]], and Leman executed for the alleged assassination of Doge **Terentius Martini**.

In the days that followed, Marsh discovered a hidden compartment in the lyre. Inside lay [[Note From Mistress|a note]] and a small [[Alf Stone|alf stone]]. The note instructed its recipient to deliver the stone to [[Greenfort]], where it could be used to dissolve a barrier erected by Ard Caëd mages. Marsh did not know for whom the message was meant, but he recognized the gravity of its contents.

For his own safety, he fled Fascesstadt, taking with him the lyre and the stone. He crafted a new name — **Spook**, a teasing nickname once given to him by Linda — and a new story: that of a traveling bard who sold songs on the road and never stayed in one place for long.

Since then, he has wandered southward, always looking over his shoulder, never daring to settle. All he knows is that the stone must reach Greenfort — and that doing so may be the only way to repay his mentor for the family he had been given, and lost.
