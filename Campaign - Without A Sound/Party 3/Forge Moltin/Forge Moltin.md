**Forge Moltin** was the son of **Forgeman Moltin** and **Livna Moltin**, born in 473 AA. He came from a long line of blacksmiths who forged their wares from materials mined by other dwarves. His clan, [[Dome Clan]], specialized in crafting armor—especially helmets—but also trained Forge in the making of weapons, tools, and other items of utility.

Forge was raised in the [[Lost Mountains]], but something about the endless mining and darkness never settled with him. He felt the dwarves were taking more from the earth than they needed, and the thought weighed on his heart. When [[House Orvyll#^BertasOrvyll|Lord Bertas Orvyll]] lowered taxes and opened the gates of [[Greentown]] to dwarven craftsmen, Forge and his family seized the opportunity to move there and establish their forge.

The business flourished, praised for the unmatched quality of its wares—many said Forge’s work seemed guided by the fire itself. Yet even amid prosperity, Forge grew restless. The town’s hunger for iron and fuel echoed the same imbalance he had fled from. His wife, **Anva Moltin**, tired of his discontent, refused to leave. So Forge left alone, entrusting his family with the forge, its brand, and their wealth, setting out toward the [[Forlornwoods]] in search of a simpler life.

The woods were harsher than he had imagined. Though his dwarven eyes pierced the dark, the cold and hunger nearly broke him. One stormy night, lightning struck a great tree before him, setting it ablaze. From the flames appeared a small, flickering creature—a _fire spirit_ in the shape of a squirrel. Whether born of magic or madness, it guided him through his struggles and taught him the ways of the druid.

Forge never abandoned his craft. Instead, he learned to blend it with nature, forging only when fire came naturally—from lightning, wild embers, or what he believed were gifts of the spirit. Travelers and wanderers soon sought him out in the woods, speaking of a dwarf who forged with patience and purpose, as if listening to the flame itself.

Though he studied druidcraft, Forge remained devoted to [[The Artisan|the Artisan]], believing the spirit was a divine gift to sustain his work. His faith and craftsmanship became one, each stroke of his hammer an act of reverence.

During the _War of Flames_, the forest grew perilous. Bloodshed and fire spread through the land, forcing Forge to shelter and tend the wounded when he could. When peace returned, he journeyed back to Greentown, only to find it reduced to ashes. His family was gone—whether dead or escaped, he never learned.

The burning of the [[Alves|Alf Tree of Veretia]] filled him with fury. To Forge, destruction was natural only when born of balance—and this was anything but. In the years that followed, the [[Forlornwoods]] twisted with danger. Green-skinned raiders and monstrous plants prowled the wilds. Forge now wanders its shadowed paths, hammer and flame in hand, defending what remains of his home and the nature he swore to protect. He is one of the last dwarves that refused to live afar from his ancient now lost home.
