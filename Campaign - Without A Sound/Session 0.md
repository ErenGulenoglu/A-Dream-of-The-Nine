- **Get to know each other.**
- **Table Rules.**
- **Learn and manage expectations. Explain the type of campaign. Travel, discovery, investigation are some elements.**
- **Describe the world, and its obvious elements (ex. Alf Trees, Magic).**
- **Suggest character types that would want to be in Forlornwoods.**
- **Bans: Dragonborn, Drow, Human Wizard, Lucky Feat**
- **Ask for mechanics they want to use: Potion Making, Item Smithing**
- **Ask for themes in their mind and classes they want to play.**
- **Roll20 character creation.**

Think about giving the scroll of disintegration to a character by tying the plot to their backstory (ex. a third party interested in the castle).

**What the people of King’s Stand know:**
- Lord [[House Orvyll#^VincentasOrvyll|Vincentas Orvyll]] has been ill for the past two months.
- His grandson, Lord [[Vincas Orvyll]], has assumed lordship in his stead, as Vincentas is too sick to govern.
- Lord Vincas has formed an alliance with [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|the mountain tribes]] to protect King’s Stand from increasing goblin incursions coming from the northwest, beyond the Lost Mountains.
- This alliance is unpopular among the townsfolk, as old disputes between the mountain tribes and the people of Utland—who live in the Forlornwoods—remain unresolved.
- Two months ago, shortly before Lord Vincentas fell ill, a militia party of thirty men was sent to eliminate the goblin threat but was ambushed and wiped out.
- Lord Vincas has ordered the construction of a wooden fortification around the town for defense.
