**What the people of King’s Stand know:**
- Lord Vincentas Orvyll has been ill for the past two months.
- His grandson, Lord Vincas Orvyll, has assumed lordship in his stead, as Vincentas is too sick to govern.
- Lord Vincas has formed an alliance with the mountain tribes to protect King’s Stand from increasing goblin incursions coming from the northwest, beyond the Lost Mountains.
- This alliance is unpopular among the townsfolk, as old disputes between the mountain tribes and the people of Utland—who live in the Forlornwoods—remain unresolved.
- Two months ago, shortly before Lord Vincentas fell ill, a militia party of thirty men was sent to eliminate the goblin threat but was ambushed and wiped out.
- Lord Vincas has ordered the construction of a wooden fortification around the town for defense.
