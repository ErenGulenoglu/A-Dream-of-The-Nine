His gravitation pull was so strong that he unwillingly ended life of one of his sleeping kin by passing the nearby star system. He was the one who tasted the bitterness of guilt and murder. He wanted to end his existence and go back to his sleeping state, and stayed stationary until he recieved the light of [[The Ethereal Fire|the Ethereal Fire]]. To end his bitterness he moved towards the light that might gave him his wish.
## Accepting The Ethereal Fire

The fire did not burned his Will, but gave him understanding of the flow between the realms. The fire revealed a sight to him that he will exist longer than any of his kin, and when the time comes and his duty of delivering the perished. He understood he was not master over the perished, but a companion that carried an important mission for time span. In the end all would return to the Will Above All. The fire made him aware, making him staying away from creating free Will and life by himself. He only assisted the ones who volunteered for the deeds.
