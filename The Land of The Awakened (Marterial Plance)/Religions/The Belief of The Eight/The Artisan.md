The Artisan values creativity, artistry, skill, and craftsmanship above all. To Him, a person’s greatness lies in the mastery of their hands and the vision of their mind. For the will’s protection, the skilled must shape, forge, and build—creating works that inspire both the sleepers and the gods. It was He who carved the mountains, laid the riverbeds, raised the lands, and hammered paths across Somnium. He bound the realms with vast chains and shaped the course of [[The River Between Realms|the River Between Realms]]. His domain reaches all corners of the world where the spark of creation takes hold—for every stone of Somnium once felt the touch of His hammer and hand.

The Artisan favors those who earn their living through craft, artistry, and workmanship, blessing them with inspiration and skill. Many smiths, engineers, architects, and artists across the [[The Senate and People of Utland]] offer prayers to Him, seeking guidance in creation and clarity in mind. Worship of the Artisan as one of the Eight is especially common in [[Veretia]], where members [[Gnome|gnomish]] society embrace craftsmanship. [[Dwarves]], too, revere the Artisan—but they name Him their father-god and reject the notion that any of the other Eight hold equal will beside Him.

The Artisan's priests wear simple grey robes and often serve within the metropolitan centers of Utland. The clerics of the Artisan are assigned to influential guilds, acting as both priests and representatives of the Church within artisan lodges. Others take on roles as architects, overseeing the construction of buildings on the church's land—including temples dedicated to the Eight and their lesser aspects, even within the sacred bounds of [[Basilica Arbitria]] itself.

To worship the Artisan, one must create a masterwork of their own craft—an item that reflects their highest skill and devotion—and place it into the greatest heat they can find, leaving it there for eight days and eight nights. This may be a forge, but among the dwarves, it is said that the true fire is the lava that flows from beneath the mountains. If the work endures without melting or warping, it is considered worthy—comparable, in some small way, to the creations of the Artisan himself—and it is believed that such a work will guide its maker to the Artisan’s great workshop in the afterlife. But if the piece melts, cracks, or fails, the worship is no less accepted. The Artisan values the courage to create and the will to test one's limits. A failed offering is seen not as rejection, but as a challenge—to create again, and to create better. For to shape the will with one’s hands is a holy act, whether the work stands or falls.
