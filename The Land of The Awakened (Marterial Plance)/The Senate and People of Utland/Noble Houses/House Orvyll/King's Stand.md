**King’s Stand** was originally the secondary settlement of [[House Orvyll]]. After their defeat by the Elven Coalition during _the War of Flames_ in 837 AA, the house was banished to the eastern half of their fiefdom and adopted King’s Stand as their new seat. It is now the only inhabited settlement remaining in the [[Forlornwoods]].

Most of the human population remained in King’s Stand, choosing to stay near the lands their families had lived on for generations. The dwarven population, however, has dwindled—many choosing to return to their kin in the [[Broken Mountains]]. King’s Stand attempted to assume the role once held by [[Greentown]] as a center of trade, but with the southern trade routes shifting once again, the region fell back into isolation.

King’s Stand survives through husbandry, woodcutting, beekeeping, hunting, fur trading, and the cultivation of forest herbs.

## Government
<hr style="margin: 0;">

The functioning government of King’s Stand is led by [[House Orvyll#^VincentasOrvyll|Lord Vincentas Orvyll]], the ruling noble of the Forlornwoods and head of House Orvyll. As sovereign lord, Vincentas holds authority over the town’s levies, legal judgments, and the allocation of resources. His word is law within the region, though he receives counsel from the town priest.

Lord Orvyll resides in the family mansion, a modest yet easily defensible structure that stands as a somber reminder of the lost **Greenfort**. In recent times (857 AA), it is said within the town that the lord has taken ill and now does not leave the manor, entrusting many of his duties to his grandson Vincas Orvyll. With his word, taxes are collected on a seasonal basis.
## Defenses
<hr style="margin: 0;">

After House Orvyll’s defeat in 837 AA, no standing army remained to guard the Forlornwoods. The local militia gradually dwindled to nothing, as what little remained of the house’s resources was redirected toward relocating the banished populace to King’s Stand.

By 857 AA, in response to the growing presence of greenskins in the western Forlornwoods, Lord Vincas Orvyll invited the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|mountain tribes]] to settle in the town as a defensive measure. The townsguard now consists of tribal axemen, pikemen, and archers. At their head stands [[Kjall, son of Kjall]], a hardened warrior and leader among his people.

With Lord Vincas's orders, a defensive wooden fortification is built around the town.

## Notable Locations

### Frostbeard Inn
<hr style="margin: 0;">

	Near the town center stands a one-story inn, built from small cut stone blocks and reinforced with hewn pine timbers. Townsfolk come and go through its well-worn door throughout the day.
This modest inn was built by the **Frostbeard brothers**, the only two dwarves who remained in King’s Stand after the War of Flames. It offers six rooms for rent and stands as one of the last remnants of dwarven presence in the town.

The innkeeper, [[Rurik Frostbeard]], was a middle-aged, dark-bearded dwarf known for his quiet hospitality. He once ran a much larger inn in Greentown and was famed for his **Frostbeard Ale**—a brew no longer made, as the local lands cannot yield the crops required. Instead, the establishment offers honey mead.

### Green Iron
<hr style="margin: 0;">

	In the town square, at the head of the forge, a dwarf with a long braided beard and a bald head pours molten metal into molds.
This smithy was built by the **Frostbeard brothers**, and is operated by **Bain Frostbeard**, a dour and prideful dwarf with a long beard, neatly trimmed and braided in the old style. Bain is the only smith in King’s Stand, though he refuses to take on apprentices, claiming his work is a pale shadow of the craft his ancestors once practiced. He limits himself to forging the everyday tools and necessities required by the townsfolk, believing true artistry belonged to his kin’s ancient traditions—most notably, the brewing of beer.

Tensions flared when a mountain tribesman demanded that Bain forge weapons and armor for his warriors. Bain refused, calling it an insult to his craft. Blades were nearly drawn that day, and blood almost spilled in the very shadow of the forge.

### Moonflower
<hr style="margin: 0;">

	Just a street away from the town square stands a two-story old building made of timber, its exterior draped in green leaves. This detached house has a set of stairs leading up to its entrance, and above the front door hangs a sign painted with a white flower.
Moonflower is a quiet apothecary nestled in a crooked street of King’s Stand. The shop is filled with the scent of dried herbs, smoke, and faintly sweet rot. Its shelves are crowded with glass jars, labeled drawers, and bundles of flora hanging from the beams.

The apothecary is owned and operated by [[Esmé]], who presents herself as a skilled herbalist and healer. Locals come here for both common remedies and obscure ingredients. While the storefront is modest and peaceful, many speak of the place with cautious respect.

### Church of The Raven
<hr style="margin: 0;">

	On the southern edge of town, isolated from the other buildings, stands a structure crowned with a high dome with a great bell atop a small hill. Its intricately cut stonework is home to numerous bird nests, and a graveyard stretches out behind it. Inside, a symbol of a one-winged raven is engraved into the farthest wall, greeting visitors as they enter.
The Church of the Raven was built with the help of local dwarves long ago, during the town’s founding. It remains the most complex structure in town, featuring a dome designed as a nesting place for birds. The dwarven cut-stone technique is evident both in the exterior craftsmanship and in the interior, where large stones connect with impressive precision.

The church also functions as a library, maintained through donations. While it contains few bound books, it preserves a wealth of knowledge in the form of scrolls accumulated over time. Some notable works include _House Orvyll: The Change of Trade Routes_, an old copy of _The Book of the Eight_, and _Song of Morning_ (a comedic stage play).

Spiritual guidance, worship rituals, and upkeep of the temple are overseen by [[Father Quinten]].  He spends most of his time at the church, teaching children—and any others interested—in reading, writing, and basic arithmetic. As a priest of the Raven, his academic specialty is history.

### King's Coin
<hr style="margin: 0;">

King's Exchange was the last remaining general trading post in King's Stand. It stood beside King's Cloaks tailory, near the heart of the town. At its founding, the establishment served to trade in bulk with caravans arriving from Utland and [[Ard Caëd]]. As the caravans grew fewer with the passing years, the Exchange shifted its focus to the sale of smaller, individual stocks.

It came to offer honey, honey mead, clothing, adventuring supplies, and a modest selection of second-hand weaponry and armor. The shopkeeper was **Dimble Oneshoe Ningel**, a gnome of sixty years, known for his haste, bargaining, fine dress, and the spectacles that seldom left his face.

### King's Cloaks
<hr style="margin: 0;">

King's Cloaks tailory stood beside King's Exchange and was run by Dimble's wife, **Lorilla Cloak Ningel**. Though caravans seldom came and went, the need for clothing in King's Stand never waned. Lorilla kept her shop open from dawn until nightfall, ever at work sewing and repairing garments.

The tailory made use of yarn spun from the goats kept in the town. Tailor Lorilla was a gnome of seventy years, known for her warmth and familiarity toward her customers. Oft before a word was spoken, she would spring from her stool to suggest what might best suit a person’s form and colour.
