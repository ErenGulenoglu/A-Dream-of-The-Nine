Notes:
- Toward the end of the eighth century, some families in the coastal regions of Etruria, Latium, and Campania began to demonstrate that they possessed wealth, status, and power on a scale far greater than others in their communities had attained.
- In the emerging cities members of the leading families also came to adopt and display a distinctive lifestyle, which marked them off from the mass of the population and often united them with the leading families in other communities.

- Consuls: When they were present in the city, they made sacrifices and performed other rites of the public cults, presided over meetings of the senate, addressed assemblies of citizens, listened to complaints, and rendered judgments. Consuls could be identified at a glance. The Roman citizen‚Äôs robe (toga) that they wore was a special one bordered in purple, the toga praetexta, and they sat on a distinctive chair inlaid with ivory, the sella curulis or ‚Äúcurule‚Äù chair. Generally, they were surrounded by attendants of various kinds: messengers, heralds to make public announcements, scribes to record their decisions, and, for each consul, twelve lictors, who maintained order in his presence and carried the fasces, double-headed axes bound in rods. The fasces were old marks of royal power in Rome and in Etruscan cities; they symbolized quite starkly the consuls‚Äô power to punish those who disobeyed them. In public, consuls took their places on platforms that elevated them over those who were to witness their actions, and their movements from place to place within the city often took on many of the attributes of processions.
- The Licinian-Sextian reforms also created the new office of praetor (initially, one elected to hold office each year). Praetors were the leading officials in Rome when the consuls were absent on campaign. When necessary, a praetor could himself command an army. Because of their regular presence in the city, holders of this office often heard testimony and issued judgments against those thought to have injured the community. Praetors would come to exercise a great deal of influence over the ways in which private disputes between citizens were resolved; thereby, they would assume a major role in the development of Roman law. Plebeians would successfully gain access to this office, too; a plebeian was praetor for the first time in 337.
- Both consuls and praetors possessed a wide range of powers and functions that were regarded as dependent upon their imperium and auspicium. Auspicium denoted their right to seek the approval of the gods for their tenure in office, and for their official actions, through the rituals of divination known as the auspices. Along with a dictator and his second-in-command, the magister equitum, every consul and praetor possessed a special right to command known as imperium, a term that is related to the verb imperare meaning ‚Äúto order‚Äù or ‚Äúto command.‚Äù For Romans, imperium had strong religious associations, and its possession was what provided the essential basis for a higher magistrate‚Äôs authority to lead armies and to punish offenders.
- Within the pomerium, the sacred boundary of the city of Rome,* however, consuls and praetors possessed only a more limited kind of imperium, qualified by the term domi (‚Äúat home‚Äù); here, they had no authority to command troops, or to ignore or brush aside all lesser officials.
- Quaestors‚Äîan office that apparently dated back to the mid-fifth century‚Äîtook care of public money. In particular, this responsibility required them to supervise the treasury (later, at least, located in the temple of Saturn), as well as to oversee the funds that generals took on campaign.
- The ten tribunes of the plebs were the most important of the lesser officeholders. Like consuls and praetors, they possessed the right to summon citizens to vote. However, many of their most important powers were essentially negative, because it was they who‚Äîthrough their ability to block public actions that they considered unlawful or inappropriate‚Äîguaranteed the rights of citizens against ill-treatment by other magistrates. Tribunes were very much officials of the city, and, in later periods at least, they were prohibited from spending much time outside of it. Beyond the first milestone outside the pomerium, tribunes no longer possessed the ability to prevent consuls and praetors from acting as they wished, so that they could not interfere with a general on campaign.

Senate (Needs adjustments) in total 300 Senators
This collection of officials did not form a government on the modern pattern;
there need be little coordination among them, and there was no central direction
of policies. Officials were expected to consult others before acting. In Rome itself,
the senate filled this advisory role. Away from the city, officeholders sought
advice from a smaller group, although it might include some senators who had
accompanied an official from Rome. The senate met only when called together by
a consul or a praetor, or later, by a tribune of the plebs, and it met in the presence
of that official. By strict rule, it could meet only in a place dedicated to the gods,
usually in a temple. Before citizens gathered to vote, senators met near the place
of assembly‚Äîthus typically in the Curia Hostilia next to the Roman Forum, or in
the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, which was adjacent to an open space, the area
Capitolina, sometimes used for voting. When conferring with a consul who had
already taken up his military command, and was thus barred from entering the
city itself, the senate would meet in a consecrated place on the Campus Martius,
just beyond the pomerium. However, the senate
would gradually assume a much more active role. In particular, it came to make
decisions in matters of religion, supervise public finances, receive embassies from
both allies and enemies, and determine military assignments for consuls and
praetors. This shift in the senate‚Äôs place in the Roman order did not go uncontested,
and it sometimes led to conflicts between the senate and individual officeholders.
Senators had a strong sense of belonging to a well-defined and honored group in
society, and, on occasion, they could be quite willing to assert the senate‚Äôs power
and prestige against magistrates and assemblies.
