**Celestine** was a human orphan from [[Fascesstadt]] who lived on the wrong side of the river. She was a member of [[Acutus]], serving under [[Varis Nai'lo]]. Her closest friends were [[Marsh Rivers]] and [[Mugaz]]. Celestine was known for her talent in planning and mischief-making.

She was caught by Varis while attempting to pass information to Marsh regarding the contents of deliveries that [[G'eldfryn Do'ghym]] brought to [[Leman of Al’Var]]. As a result of this incident—and her general standing within the group—she was regarded as one of the disrespected members of the gang.
