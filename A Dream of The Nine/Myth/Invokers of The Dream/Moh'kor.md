## Origins
Moh'kor was an ever impatient red dwarf. He combined his [[Lexicon#^theWill|will]] with his brother [[Meh'ker]] to awake into the endlessness. From the first moment he wanted to seek celestial objects, smelt and mix them together with his ever red surface to give shape to them. During their journeys with Meh'ker, he challenged him and got challenged by him many times to display strength and skill. Many times they wrestled and clashed, shaking the emptiness around them.

During his journeys with his brother, they met with [[Soliel]] and the three decided to continue their journeys together. During this period of time, Meh'ker understood his brother has taken interest in her more than anything in the endlessness.
## Accepting The Ethereal Fire
He was the third one who passed from [[The Ethereal Fire|the Ethereal Fire]], and embraced the skillfulness that only [[The Will Above All|the Will Above All]] possessed in its brush strokes of the endlessness. The Ethereal Fire strengthened his shape, bestowing him [[Dr√ºzz'gill]], and skill over craft. And, the fire burned his will, giving him ambition to craft and shape, closing his eyes to the cost of creation.
