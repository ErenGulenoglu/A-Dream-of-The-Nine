god of courage, tactician, 
## Origins
Meh'ker was a still and resilient red rocky desert planet. He woke up alone next to his brother—[[Moh'kor]]—who was trying to extend his [[Lexicon#^theWill|will]] to the endlessness to gain free will. The first emotion he felt when he saw that was fear. The fear of his brother not waking up, and being alone in the endlessness. As soon as he gained his free will, he combined his will with his brother to wake him from a heavy sleep. The only purpose he found for himself in the endlessness was to help his brother and all [[Lexicon#^CelestialBody|celestial bodies]] that were in need. During their journeys together with Moh'kor, he loved to display his skills, wrestle and clash with his brother.

During their journeys, they met with [[Soliel]]. Meh'ker was amazed by beauty of the brilliant white-golden light that Soliel spread, sharing her will with all free and sleeping wills,. Meh'ker wanted to help her with all he can for her to share her light and will to make sleeping celestial bodies awake with warmth of companionship and kin. He asked to her to orbit around her many times even though this act scorched his surface, melting his rocks. They changed their satellites, shared their wills, and three of them together wandered the endlessness to reach out to their kin.
## Accepting The Ethereal Fire
Meh'ker followed the beacon—[[The Ethereal Fire|the Ethereal Fire]]—with Moh'kor and Soliel. When they met with the keeper of the fire—[[The Great Raven|the Great Raven]]—, Meh'ker felt the same fear he had in his beginning for all celestial bodies there, except [[The Ninth|the Ninth]]. The Ninth's magnificent dimension, how he absorbed the light of Soliel and the Ethereal Fire, and the size of his will scared him. The only think he could think was to help others by protecting them from the black hole.

He was the fourth one who passed from the Ethereal Fire, and embraced the courage and mind for tactics over battles of will that only [[The Will Above All|the Will Above All]] possessed. The Ethereal Fire burned him to his core, grew and powered him in size of frame, filled him with pure courage, and will—making him protector of the dreamers. And the fire tied his thoughts on Soliel even tighter than before, erasing all fear in him, opening his will to anger.

He stood close to Soliel and Meh'ker, putting himself between them and the Ninth.
