#Somniatore
mother earth, the ever-young, the sleeper
## Origins
Nebula was an enormous luminescent living cloud and dust, vitalizing any celestial objects she touched upon from the first moment she awake into the endlessness. She was astonished how her touch was changing celestial objects, and how there was no end to the bodies she can touch upon. Even though, her will was great, and her cloud was massive, she realized touching upon other [[Lexicon#^theWill|wills]] tired her and lessened her.
## Accepting The Ethereal Fire
She was the fifth one who passed from the Ethereal Fire, and embraced fertility that only [[The Will Above All|the Will Above All]] possessed. [[The Ethereal Fire]] blessed her aura, giving her the creativity over birthing new living frames for free wills and restoring them by parting her own will. And the fire burned her to tiredness that only the Will Above All knew, making her leave for resting sleep for certain periods to rest and continue giving, restoring, and accepting life.
