Before Utland was formed, many [[Human|human]] tribes lived around the large geography known as the Land of the Awakened. Humans gave the name of the land out of a myth that is believed as the first people who were to ever live in these land did not immigrated but awakened laying bare on the land.

Out of these people formed many small and large countries, but as they reached their height before the conquest, the most prominent of them were:
- The Kingdom of Mirna (North)
- The Kingdom of Orfyn (East)
- The Kingdom of Ros (South)
- The Kingdom of Euandros (West)

Although they spoke of same language, depending upon the geography their religion, skin color, their pronunciations changed.
