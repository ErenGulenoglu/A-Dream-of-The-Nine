In 838 AA, the mightiest kingdom **the Land of the Awakened** had ever known—**the Great Kingdom of Utland**—collapsed beneath the weight of its monarch’s choices. King [[Chronology of Utland#^GalvynII|Galvyn II von Ewfai]] now remembered as *the Last*, warred with his allies, [[Veretia]] and [[Ard Caëd]], masters of the arcane, and led the burning of the sacred **Alf Tree of the East**. What remains of Utland since *the War of Flames* is now a scattered mosaic: the fractured [[Small Kingdoms]], the wandering tribes beyond the Blue Desert, and a senate of Utland’s aristocracy, slowly rising from the ashes.

SPQU—**The Senate and People of Utland**—was forged by the will of Steward [[Chronology of Utland#^HeberIllarion|Heber Illarion]], who sought to halt the realm’s disintegration. At his summons, high-aristocracy, powerful merchants, the Vicar himself, influential nobles, and voices of the common folk gathered to form a new representative body. This council steered negotiations of peace with Veretia and Ard Caëd. Just a month later, in 838 AA, the Kingdom of Utland was formally dissolved, and the Republic of Utland was born—ushering a fragile peace back into the realm.

## Regime and Politics
<hr style="margin: 0;">

SPQU is a painting of a republic where the brushstrokes belong to the aristocracy and wealthy merchants, where **the Senate**'s edicts carry authority throughout the whole country, while the commands of feudal lords are limited to their own lands. The Senate is the heart of Utland — a society that claims to represent all the people of Utland and the will of the Eight — where its members gather in the Basilica Arbitria. **Senators** consist of the wealthiest, most influential, and most established noble houses of Utland, who serve for a lifetime. New senators are elected by the **Comitia Centuriata** every five years; however, the privilege of initiating one's voting right is based on socioeconomic status and citizenship. As a result, those who enter the Senate are usually assigned or backed by the wealthy aristocracy. The two hundred wealthiest citizens of the republic participates in the Comitia Centuriata, which convenes to elect magistrates and, every five years, oversaw the addition of new senators through the census conducted by the censors.

Also, in SPQU, there is the **Concilium Plebis**, a council composed solely of plebeians who elect the three **Tribuni Plebis** to the Senate every five years. The tribunes of the plebs do not have the right to vote like senators, but they can demand the floor to speak in the name of the plebeians and can veto senatorial decisions.

SPQU's inherited feudalism is not limited to voting rights or representation. The republican mechanism serves as a refined method for the aristocracy to maintain control over the country without storming each other’s castles. The hierarchy within the _Comitia Centuriata_ mirrors the noble order of the republic itself. **Knights** are the lowest tier of nobility, and some rise from the plebeian class through merit or service. Many are skilled warriors—hedge knights who wander the realm in service to lords—while a rare few hold small castles or parcels of land. Local **lords** are landed nobles of lesser influence, holding ancestral estates and answering to **barons**, who govern clusters of villages and major towns. **Counts** serve as the highest-ranking governors of the republic’s provinces; some among them claim descent from the kings who ruled before Utland’s transformation into one kingdom. With one exception: House Ros, the ruling family of the southern province, bears the unique title of **duke**—the only such title above count—due to their blood ties to the now-extinct royal line of von Ewfai.

## Military Structure
<hr style="margin: 0;">

**The Regnant**
SPQU’s military traditions evolved with [[Chronology of Utland#^OwynI|Owyn I von Ewfai]] uniting the realm in 591 AA by bringing the military culture of **the regnant** to Utland. The regnant was the backbone of the kingdom, solely loyal to the king, establishing his authority over the noble houses and expanding his realm, gathering all humans under one flag. The regnant were trained from their childhood; the recruiter commanders were allowed by the king to honor boys by recruiting them to train them as loyal, disciplined soldiers to the king by taking them to their central encampments in the provinces. However, after _the War of the Flames_, legions of the king were hunted and killed by the combined forces of [[Ard Caëd]] and the Senate, for they were seen as a military threat to the union of elves and the new government, as a reminder of the legitimacy of the kingdom.

**Provincial Armies**
Every county and dukedom has the right to raise its own loyal armies in addition to their bannerman's. The majority of the republic’s defense relies on the provincial protection provided by provincial rulers professional armies.

**Armies of The Noble Houses**
Old aristocratic houses and wealthy nobles in the border regions see raising their own loyal battalions as a necessary measure to protect their settlements from greenskins, banditry, partitioners, rival neighbors, and the ancient evils awakened from the depths of Somnium. Noble houses residing in the inner provinces of the republic are often content with their personal guards, but are occasionally seen hiring mercenaries—for crows still circle over the corpse of the dissolved kingdom, and both small bands and large forces seek to pick it apart and pillage what remains.

**Militia**
Militia consists of part-time fighting force made up of ordinary citizens—such as farmers, laborers, or tradespeople—who are trained to defend their community in times of danger. Unlike professional soldiers, militia members return to their daily lives when not called to serve. They are typically organized by barons and lords, and expected to rally quickly in response to threats like invasions, raids, or emergencies.
