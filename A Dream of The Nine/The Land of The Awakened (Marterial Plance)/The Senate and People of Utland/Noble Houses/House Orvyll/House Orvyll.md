## History
<hr style="margin: 0;">

***Lord Vincas Orvyll (725 AA - 770 AA)*** 
^VincasOrvyll

Vincas served as the captain of the **Green Companions**, a mercenary company operating between [[Ard Caëd]] and the Vallée d'été. The company gained a reputation for protecting local towns and villages from greenskin raiders during the mid-seventh century AA.

In 693 AA, during King [[Malyr I von Ewfai]]’s royal progress to Ard Caëd, the volcano [[Mont Colère]] erupted, devastating southwestern [[Rosefall]] and blocking the main southern road. The king's entourage was forced to divert through the Forlornwoods, where they were ambushed by [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods|mountain tribes]] descending from [[Lost Mountains]]. Surrounded and unable to advance, the king’s host was in peril. Dwarven reinforcements from Lost Mountains were reportedly held at the river by tribal resistance.

Upon learning of the king's situation, the Green Companions marched swiftly into the forest. Instead of using the main road, they cut through an overgrown woodland path and attacked the ambushers’ flank, relieving the royal host. For his actions, Vincas was knighted by King Malyr I on the field and granted lordship over the Forlornwoods.

Following his elevation, Lord Vincas disbanded the Green Companions. Many of its members swore loyalty and formed the core of his household guard. Under his rule, the Forlornwood was gradually cleared of tribal threats, and a new trade route between Utland and Ard Caëd was established through his domain.

The first settlement under his rule grew near the southern forest edge and later became known as [[Greentown]], the seat of House Orvyll. He died of spring sickness in 738 AA. His birth year is not known, but he is estimated to be in his sixties at the time of his decease.

***Lord Bertas Orvyll (770 AA - 827 AA)*** 
^BertasOrvyll

Lord Bertas Orvyll was born in 745 AA's winter. He succeeded his father at the age of 25 in the spring of 770 AA and inherited his vision of developing Greentown into a central trade hub where the goods of Ard Caëd, Utland, and the dwarven clans of the Lost Mountains could be exchanged. He signed a local military alliance pact with the dwarven clans of the Lost Mountains against greenskins and mountain men.

A population increase occurred during his rule, as human peasants migrated into the region. Lord Bertas lowered taxes to a minimum, offering generous incentives: households with a pregnant woman were exempt from taxation for eight years, newly arrived families were granted rent-free land for ten years, and the selling tax was maintained at three in forty. Among the dwarves of Lost Mountains, several groups chose to settle in Greentown as resident smiths and traders, further contributing to the town's growth and prosperity.

After the first fifteen years of his rule, the lord turned his attention to establishing a second, smaller settlement in the eastern reaches of the Forlornwoods. He named the colony King's Stand, in honor of his father's deeds and the heroic defense of King Malyr I against [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods]]. King's Stand grew steadily, finding prosperity through hunting, timber production, and pitch making.

In the twenty-fifth year of his rule, at the proposition of his dwarven allies, Lord Bertas invested in the mining sector within the Forlornwoods. As the forest lay in a valley between the Lost Mountains, it was believed that the land beneath might yield the same treasures found within the mountains themselves. In 792 AA, dwarf miners discovered the roots of [[Alves]] spreading beneath the Forlornwoods, along with a root vein that produced [[Alf Stone|alf stones]]. In the years that followed, construction began on [[Greenfort]], built atop the newly discovered vein.

In his final years, the lord sought to bring elven and gnomish master craftsmen and spellcasters skilled in the shaping of alf stone to his lands, sending envoys with offers of patronage and alliance. However, his proposals were rejected. In 825 AA, he sent his son, **Vincentas Orvyll**, on a long journey to the [[Broken Mountains]] to seek guidance in the processing of alf stones.

Lord Bertas died a year and a half later, while his son was still on the road returning. He did not live to see his vision fulfilled—the trade of magical goods crafted in Greentown never came to life in his time. He died at the age of 82.

***Lord [[Vincentas Orvyll]] (827 AA - Current)*** 
^VincentasOrvyll

Lord Vincentas Orvyll was born in the fall of 787 AA. He succeeded his father at the age of forty, upon returning from a diplomatic mission to the [[Broken Mountains]], bringing with him the renowned master craftsman [[Ebrek Rubyhammer]] to the Forlornwoods.

In his early life, Vincentas earned acclaim in 808 AA by winning the melee at the [[Tournament of Roses]], where he was knighted by [[House Rose#^JacquesI|Duke Jacques I Rose]].

He focused his fiefdom's economy on the processing of alf stones, seeking to fulfill his father's vision of establishing a market for magical items within the borders of Utland. To offset the costs of this endeavor, he withdrew from the broader mining sector, keeping only the alf stone mine beneath Greenfort operational. He did not expand the number of settlements under his rule. Instead of directing the growing population toward labor or agriculture, he enlisted many into his militia, strengthening his military presence in the region.

In 836 AA, during the Kingdom of Utland’s invasion of [[Veretia]], Lord Vincentas Orvyll led his militia under the command of King [[Chronology of Utland#^GalvynII|Galvyn II von Ewfai]]. He commanded the 10th cohort of the **4th Regnant** and was among those who carried out the burning of the [[Alves|Alf]] of Veretia.

A year later, during _the War of Flames_, he defended his stronghold at Greenfort against a siege by the Elven Coalition. The western settlements of his fiefdom were razed in the conflict. During the siege, his son **Valdas Orvyll** and Valdas’s wife **Alma Orvyll** were killed when a castle tower collapsed under a blast of destructive magic. Their five-year-old son **Vincas** survived, found in the arms of his mother beneath the rubble. Ultimately, Greenfort fell to the elven armies, who held control over powerful arcane forces. The victors cast a protective enchantment over the ruins, rendering Greenfort magically sealed and impassable. Lord Vincentas and the surviving populace, having surrendered, were banished to King’s Stand.

After the collapse of the Kingdom of Utland, the political standing of House Orvyll was left ambiguous. Stripped of their former influence, they were unable to rebuild their destroyed settlements, nor did they possess the wealth they had once commanded. Following the peace conferences, the major trade routes were redirected through the southwest of [[Rosefall]], bypassing the Forlornwoods and further diminishing House Orvyll’s strategic and economic significance.
