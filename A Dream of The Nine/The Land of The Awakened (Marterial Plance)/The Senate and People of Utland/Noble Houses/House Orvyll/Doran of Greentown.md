**Doran** was a Lawful Good **veteran** who served as the captain of the guard for [[House Orvyll]]. Trusted by both lord and folk alike, he was known for his unwavering sense of justice and disciplined command of martial skill. His demeanor was friendly and respectful, yet firm. Discipline ran deep in him, and this was reflected in the order and conduct of the town’s militia under his watch.

He was a lean and agile man, his face lined with age, telling of his forty years. Strands of gray ran through his dark brown hair, though his face remained ever clean-shaven. He wore well-maintained splint armor, carried a crossbow across his back, and bore a longsword at his hip—kept ever sharp and ready.

Though age had begun to dull the edge of his physical prowess, his mind remained sharp. His memory was perfect, and he remembered every detail of his life and of _the War of the Flames_.

He was born in Greentown in 815 AA. It was his father who first enlisted him into the militia. In 837 AA, at the age of twenty-two, he fought in the defense of [[Greenfort]] against the Elven Coalition. After the defeat and the house's subsequent relocation to [[King's Stand]], he was appointed captain of the guard. He had upheld that duty faithfully for the past twenty years.
