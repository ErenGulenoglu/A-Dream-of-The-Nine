### Description
<hr style="margin: 0;">

**Lovers' Fey Tree** was a place where trees differed from the needled species of eastern [[Forlornwoods]], marked instead by colorful leaves and soft light. At its center stood a singular fey tree with gently glowing leaves, around which fireflies gathered. The grove was peaceful, and many animals preferred it as a place of habitation.
### History
<hr style="margin: 0;">

The tree marked the grave of a fallen elven warrior, who perished during _the Era of the Moon_, slain while fighting against _Followers of The Ninth_. After his burial, the essence of [[Feywild]] in his body caused trees with vibrant leaves to grow across a small portion of eastern [[Forlornwoods]]. At the site of his resting place, the fey tree took root.
### Inhabitants

Even an **owlbear** named Burbur took refuge within the range of the tree, after being driven from western Forlornwoods by [[Burned Claws Tribe]].

[[Typha, Friend of Forlornwoods]] lived here, bound to the tree, as the fallen warrior had been her lover. She tried to protect the grove by placing druidic marks upon the surrounding trees, which unconsciously suggested that travelers change their paths.
