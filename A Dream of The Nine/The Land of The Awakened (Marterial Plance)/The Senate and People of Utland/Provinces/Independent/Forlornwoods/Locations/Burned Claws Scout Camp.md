**Burned Claws Scout Camp** was a small front base of [[Burned Claws Tribe]] in [[Forlornwoods]]. It was stationed to check movements of [[King's Stand]] forces, and to secure supply transfers to [[Shrine of Cleansing]]. The scout camp is under the command of **Norr**, a bugbear lieutenant in [[Cannibal Brits]]'s army. Initially this camp housed 9 goblins and 1 bugbear, but 4 goblins were killed out in the forest during their scouting missions by adventurer parties which came from King's Stand.
## General Features
- A natural cave that formed inside a hill in the forest was inhabited by Burned Claws Tribe.
- The ground level of the cave is generally straight.
- _**Ceilings.**_ Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.
- _**Light.**_ Outside is bright with daylight, or can be dark depending on the daytime. The rest of the complex is dark. Characters will require _darkvision_ or a light source to see in the cave.
- _**Sound.**_ Any sound made inside the cave echoes, and can be heard from any place of the cave.
## What the Goblins Know
 - Their tribe is called the [Burned Claws Tribe](app://obsidian.md/Burned%20Claws%20Tribe). Their chief’s name is [Cannibal Brits](app://obsidian.md/Cannibal%20Brits). The tribe’s main stronghold is in [Greentown](app://obsidian.md/Greentown). Brits wants to conquer King’s Stand before winter and end human dominance in the forest entirely. Brits has hobgoblin lieutenants and keeps a creature known as [Iennos, The Shadow](app://obsidian.md/Iennos,%20The%20Shadow) always at his side.
- There are two separate camps in the forest. The [main camp](app://obsidian.md/Shrine%20of%20Cleansing) is a ruined dwarven temple in the south of the forest. The [scout camp](app://obsidian.md/Burned%20Claws%20Scout%20Camp) is built atop a large rocky outcrop within the woods.
- The scout camp exists to monitor King’s Stand’s military movements. The main force, however, is gathered at the dwarven temple to the east.
- The scout camp also serves as a supply point. Supplies and new soldiers mounted on **worgs** are sent directly from Greentown to the southern camp. The camp is surrounded by traps.
- The main host on the east side of the forest is searching for tomb of a dwarf named [[Ebrek Rubyhammer]].
## 1. Outside

	As you follow the trails, and approach to side of a hill in the forest, a cave mouth appears between the trees and bushes. 
- In front the cave mouth, behind bushes there are two goblins that are standing on guard. The goblins who have been here for a long time are careless and talking among each other in low voices for they are afraid of **Norr**'s wrath.
- They can notice huge paw prints left on the earth, similar to a wolf but much bigger. On **DC 14** Survival check, they can understand these prints are 3 days old.
	- Tracks belong to **Worgs**, that went to join the main host at Shrine of Cleansing.

## 2. Treasure Room of Norr
- **Norr** does not trust his goblins, and built a makeshift cage wall with a simple lock on it taken from one of the supply chest. The cage wall can be destroyed, but will make a lot of sound
	- To open the lock characters are required to succeed on a **DC 15** Thieves' Tools check.

**Treasure**
Arrow ×20, two backpacks, ball bearings, a bedroll, a bell, five candles, a chest, two sets of common clothes, a crowbar, a holy symbol (emblem), a hammer, holy water, a hooded lantern, a longsword, a mace, manacles, a mess kit, a steel mirror, two flasks of oil, ten pitons, a quiver, twelve days of rations, two 50-foot lengths of hempen rope, a shield, string, two tinderboxes, eight torches, vestments, two waterskins, a wooden stake, fifteen gold pieces, and one silver piece.
## 3. Cages
Deeper in the cave, goblins spared a corner for prisoners with two makeshift cages locked with locks taken out of supply chests.
- In one of the cages **Haddock** stays imprisoned.
	- He was caught in the forest by goblins in an ambush, when he went out to search for his daughter 2 days after she did not return.
	- Haddock is imprisoned for the last 3-4 days. He was only given water and no food. He has 4 levels of exhaustion.
- Haddock knows goblins language, and deciphered what they know from their conversations. Check **What the Goblins Know** section.
## 4. Headquarters
- Headquarters are where goblins rest, plan, and spend their times when they are not out in the forest.
- **Norr** is a bugbear lieutenant that scares goblins. He thinks of himself as a tactical genius and a great commander.
	- He sent 2 of his goblins to keep watch in chance of any intruders that might find their cave, 3 goblins to the forest to scout in the forest, and keeps 3 goblins in the cave so no one gets close to his treasures that he earned through tactically placing goblins in the forest.
- **Norr** carries keys to prisoner cages and treasure room.
