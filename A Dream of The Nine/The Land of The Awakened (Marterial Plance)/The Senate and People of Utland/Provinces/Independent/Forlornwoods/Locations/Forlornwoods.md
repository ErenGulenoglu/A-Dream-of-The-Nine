**Forlornwoods** is the fiefdom of [[House Orvyll]]. Before _the War of Flames_, it served as a key passage along the southern trade route. Long before the Awakening, the area was a vast lake. In that era, dwarves shaped the land and the [[Lost Mountains]] to carve a flow path for the _Rock River_. After the Awakening, the lake gave way to forest, and the region became what is now known as Forlornwoods.

## Geography
<hr style="margin: 0;">

**Geographical Features**
Forlornwoods is a valley between Lost Mountains, divided in two by _Rock River_. It is a dense forest located in the southwest of Utland. The inner regions of the valley are notably flat, while the edges near the mountains consist of rocky hills. The whole forest is approximately 1600 square miles.

In 791 AA, it was discovered that the roots of the [[Alves|Alf]] run beneath the valley, connecting two distant geographies through the earth below.

By taking the main road, travelers may enter Forlornwoods from either the west or the east and, if they do not stop, reach the far side of the forest in about one day.

**Overland Travel**
- From the eastern entrance of the forest to King’s Stand takes approximately **10 hours** at a normal pace.
- From King’s Stand to the bridge that connects both sides of the forest takes approximately **6 hours** at a normal pace.
- From Greentown to the bridge that connects both sides of the forest takes approximately **4 hours** at a normal pace.
- From Greentown to Greenfort takes approximately **1 hour** at a normal pace.
- From Greentown to the western entrance of the forest takes approximately **8 hours** at a normal pace.
- It takes approximately **10 hours** to travel on foot from the northern Lost Mountains to the southern Lost Mountains at normal pace.

**Flora & Fauna**
The valley is forested with various tree types—hardwoods on the west side and softwoods on the east. The western forest is home to oak, maple, hickory, beech, birch, and fruit-bearing ash trees, while the eastern side features pine, spruce, fir, cedar, hemlock, and other needle-leaved varieties.

In addition, various uniquely shaped trees with multicolored leaves commonly grow in the western part. These trees are said to have sprung from the bodies of elves who died during the siege of Greenfort and were buried within the forest afterward.

The overall atmosphere and grass tend to be brighter and more colorful on the western side of the forest, as it is one of the rare places touched by the light of the Alf of [[Ard Caëd]].

## Inhabitants
<hr style="margin: 0;">

Forlornwoods was once the land of the [[The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods]], before it became the property of Lord Vincas Orvyll in 725 AA. Since then, the Bear Tribe lost their footholds in the forest and were forced back into the hills, caverns, and crags of the Lost Mountains. Forlornwoods gradually became home to settlers from Utland, as well as halflings and dwarves.

Before the War of Flames, the people of House Orvyll inhabited [[Greentown]]. After the war, the human, dwarf, and halfling populations shifted to [[King's Stand]], leaving the western Forlornwoods to [[Burned Claws Tribe]] around 856 AA.

In addition, [[Saltuarius Tribe]]—a small migrant gatherers—travelled in the forest seasonally.

After _the War of Flames_, as the region grew more isolated, sightings of goblinoids became increasingly common.

It is said that Forlornwoods still harbors ancient nature spirits who hide themselves from the sleepers.

## Wilderness

Forlornwoods is not safe. The place is haunted by the ghosts of people who died during the siege of Greenfort, monsters that born out of darkness that seeped in the forest, and beasts of the nature.
