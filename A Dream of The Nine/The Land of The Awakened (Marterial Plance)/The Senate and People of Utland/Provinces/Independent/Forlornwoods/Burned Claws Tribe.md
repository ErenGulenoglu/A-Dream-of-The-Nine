The Burned Claws Tribe immigrated to the [[Forlornwoods]] from the [[Giant Foothills]] under the command of [[Iennos, The Shadow]]. Comprising goblins, bugbears, and hobgoblins, they settled in the western reaches of the Forlornwoods in 856 AA.

Once fractured into warring clans, the tribe had long been plagued by infighting. However, under the leadership of [[Cannibal Brits]] and his cadre of hobgoblin captains, they were forged into a disciplined war host. Bugbears served as lieutenants, while goblins filled the ranks as common soldiers. Inside the tribe, Iennos acted as Brits' advisor.

The tribe worshipped [[Maglubiyet]], the god of conquest and domination. As a sign of devotion, each member burned part of their bodyâ€”an offering of pain to prove their fearlessness and worthiness in the eyes of their god.
