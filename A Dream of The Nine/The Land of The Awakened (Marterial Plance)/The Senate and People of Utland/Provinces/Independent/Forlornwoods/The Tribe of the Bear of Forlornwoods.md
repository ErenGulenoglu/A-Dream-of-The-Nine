The Tribe of the Bear of Forlornwoods was a clan whose ancestors dwelt long in isolation, far from the central Lands of the Awakened. [[The Senate and People of Utland|SPQU]] deemed them barbaric and uncivilized.

Until the year 770 AA, the tribe held sway over the Forlornwoods and the outer reaches of the [[Lost Mountains]]. That year marked their retreat, for they were driven from the valley and forced into the mountain ranges, relinquishing their dominion. Life grew harsher for the clansmen thereafter, for they no longer possessed the might to waylay caravans nor harry military envoys as they once did.

When the dwarves lost their halls in the mountains after the burning of the [[Alves|Alf of Veretia]], the Bear tribe considered claiming the empty holds. Yet, they soon forsook the thought, for strange sounds echoed from the deepâ€”sounds that no man among them could name, nor dared to face.

The arrival of the [[Burned Claws Tribe]] in the Forlornwoods pressed them further into the northern heights. By the command of [[Kjall, son of Kjall]], then chief of the tribe, an uneasy alliance was struck with [[House Orvyll]], the very foes who had once driven them out. The clansmen spoke ill of their chief for this choice, and murmurs of challenge stirred among them. A contest for leadership loomed near.
