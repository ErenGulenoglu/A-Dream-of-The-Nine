**Fascesstadt**, also known as the _Republic of Thieves_, was the second-largest city in Utland and a hub for dwarven trading goods traveling north via the [[Copper River]]. The city was one of the most important financial centers of the realm, home to bourgeois artists and guildsmen who influenced the realm’s economy, as well as criminal organizations that managed the darker side of trade, including smuggling rare and illegal materials and offering various illicit services.

Militarily, Fascesstadt was not among the strongest cities in Utland, relying heavily on mercenary companies for its city guard and men-at-arms. In terms of population, Fascesstadt was one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Utland, with a diverse society composed of humans, dwarves, half-elves, tieflings, gnomes, halflings, half-orcs, and, more rarely, wood elves.

## Etymology
<hr style="margin: 0;">

The city's original name was _River Court_ before the rule of [[von Ewfai]].

The city's current name, "Fascesstadt," emerged after [[Chronology of Utland#^EwynI|Ewyn I von Ewfai]] was assassinated by [[Sergej Tepes]], brother of [[Lugos Tepes]]. Sergej had disguised himself as a wounded soldier and approached Ewyn while he was walking on the battlefield after the fighting had ended, slaying him.

The word _Fasces_ refers to a bound bundle of wooden rods, symbolizing unity among the guilds and their governance. The word _stadt_ emphasizes the city's size and strength, giving the full name the meaning of "City of Unity."
## Geography
<hr style="margin: 0;">

Fascesstadt was considered the heart of the [[Riverlands]], serving as the central metropolis where the western trade route and the Copper River came close to each other. The city was built on both sides of the Copper River.
## History
<hr style="margin: 0;">

After succeeding his father in 583 AA, [[Chronology of Utland#^OwynI|Owyn I von Ewfai]] initiated a coup d'état against [[House Tepes]], collaborating with the guilds of _River Court_ in 584 AA. The guilds overthrew Tepes family, executing Voivode Lugos Tepes and sending his head as a gift to the conqueror of Utland. As a result, the city became a vassal and was granted autonomy under the rule of von Ewfai, with governance entrusted to the guilds.

## Government
<hr style="margin: 0;">

Before 584 AA, Fascesstadt was ruled by a Voivode, the elected monarch of the Riverlands. The Voivode’s seat was located in Fascesstadt, from which he governed the rest of the Riverlands as centralized vassals and served as the supreme military commander of the region.

After 584 AA, with the voivodeship abolished, the city transitioned into a merchant republic. Its central governing body became the Great Council, with councillorship open to all adult male guild members (at least 25 years old) of recognized bourgeois families who lived in King's Bank. Councillorship was hereditary and limited to 200 seats. The symbolic head of the government was the Doge, elected for life. His influence stemmed more from personal prestige and respect than from formal authority attached to his office. The Great Council gathers at Cathedral of St. Belenus, at King's Bank. A councillor was also known as a “yellowjacket,” as the formal attire of council members included bright yellow jackets.

On the Voivode’s Bank, there were no official representatives of illegal activity, but prominent gangs ruled their own territories autonomously, generally maintaining an understanding with the city’s legal authorities. Mob leaders and councillors remained in contact through unofficial channels, each managing their respective sides of the trade networks.
## Defenses
<hr style="margin: 0;">

After 584 AA, with the Voivode’s forces disbanded, Fascesstadt had neither a conscription system nor a strong sense of patriotic military identity. The city relied primarily on mercenary companies, employing approximately 500 city guards as a policing force, stationed mainly on the King’s Bank.

During the _War of Flames_, when the threat of the elven coalition laying siege to the city emerged, a professional army was assembled from volunteers, a newly enacted conscription law, and hired mercenaries. This force ultimately reached a strength of nearly 15,000 troops. It is also said that the council hired runaway spellcasters as well, though the authorities deny these claims.
## Law & Order
<hr style="margin: 0;">

Fascesstadt’s Voivode’s Bank is the breeding ground where all illegal activity in [[The Senate and People of Utland|SPQU]] takes root. Numerous major and minor criminal organizations operate there, engaging in thievery, assassination, smuggling, espionage, kidnapping, robbery, money laundering, illegal minting, forgery, and countless other illicit practices. These activities are unofficially tolerated by the authorities on the King’s Bank—so long as those on the Voivode’s Bank do not interfere with the interests of the councilors.

Occasionally, orphans and beggars who were seen anywhere but Cathedral of St. Belenus in the King’s Bank were beaten to death by the city guards, a brutal measure intended to keep the eastern side of the river “clean” of the scum from the wrong side.

City guards rarely patrol the Voivode’s Bank, and when they do, they never respond to any cries for help. The golden rule for those living on the wrong side of the river is simple: do not steal from the guards, and never cross the “yellowjackets.”
## Society
<hr style="margin: 0;">

From the city’s founding in the 2nd century AA until the mid-6th century AA, Fascesstadt was known as a welcoming, stern, and industrious city. The Voivodes of the Riverlands consistently invested in the guilds and maintained good relations with them, always seeking to attract more population to strengthen the workforce.

The smallfolk—workers of the city who lived on the western bank of the river—formed the wealthiest middle class in Utland. Compared to the rural regions of the Riverlands, most smallfolk were literate and numerate. They were known as stoic, hardworking, and honest people who took pride in the lives they had built.

The bourgeoisie, guildmembers, artists, nobles, and wealthy citizens lived on the eastern bank of the river. This affluent population came from every corner of Utland. They were famous for their skill in crafts, attending theatre plays, hiring artists for portraiture, and participating in lavish social gatherings. They were equally known for their arrogance, cunning, and sly reputation. Most owned workshops and employed smallfolk to produce and sell exquisite goods.

When the voivodeship—which had maintained a balance between the elite and the plebeians—was abolished in 584 AA, the wealthy became increasingly stingy and authoritarian toward the smallfolk. Wages fell, work hours lengthened, and new policies were enacted that served only the interests of the upper class. As a consequence, the working class of the Voivode’s Bank gradually turned to shady means of earning a living, refusing to become servants of those across the river. Over time, societal anger and a spirit of revenge took root in the hearts of once-respected workers—now pushed into criminality.

Yet even within the Voivode’s Bank, there remained people who held to a personal code of honor. They sought non-violent ways to resolve conflicts among themselves, preferring to direct their efforts against the powerful on the King’s Bank rather than each other. Others, however, embraced the new order of controlled chaos, thriving in the criminal underworld and climbing its ruthless hierarchy, ensuring that anyone who stood in their path would fall.

Meanwhile, the elite did not concern themselves with carrying weapons or acknowledging the poverty on the opposite bank. As time passed, they grew more ambitious and more hypocritical, for the path into the realm’s politics had widened for them—and only for them.
## Trade & Business
<hr style="margin: 0;">

Since the 3rd century AA, the city has served as the primary trade hub through which dwarven goods flowed into northern Utland, carried from the [[Broken Mountains]] via the Copper River and the surrounding land routes. After the rise of [[House Orvyll]] in 725 AA and its securing of southwestern Utland, Fascesstadt later became part of the broader trade network of [[Ard Caëd]] and [[Dol Caëd]], distributing elven goods arriving from the south to the rest of Utland.

In its early years, Fascesstadt functioned mainly as a wood-trading port due to its proximity to the [[Edannas Forest]]. Its principal exports were planks and tree sap. This later changed dramatically in the 3rd century AA, when Voivode Dragomir led discoveries of copper deposits along the Copper River and across various parts of the Riverlands. With these findings, the city began minting its own coins from local copper beds while opening new markets for refined bronze goods such as urns, vases, plates, mirrors, cups, and many other luxury items.

From the 3rd to the early 6th century AA, bronze production transformed the city’s economy, steadily increasing its wealth and enabling significant development of its infrastructure. As this economic boom grew, it attracted artists from across Utland, encouraged by the Voivodes’ incentives. These artisans founded workshops, brought their trade connections with them, and formed an educated, ambitious elite seeking business opportunities in the city.

With these changes, Fascesstadt’s trade operations evolved in cooperation with the [[Broken Mountains]] and the increasing involvement of dwarven crafters. Rare materials, such as raw precious stones, were brought to the city to be refined, shaped, and ultimately sold as exquisite jewelry to the nobility of Utland. Over time, additional sectors—including smithing, glassmaking, parchment production, clothing, leatherworking, and bootmaking—also developed and flourished.

This influx of artisans and traders ultimately led to the establishment of the guilds and the rise of a powerful bourgeoisie—one that, over time, became an economic rival to the Voivodes themselves. Eventually, this rivalry climaxed with voivodeship taken down by guilds, and acceptance of rule of von Ewfai.

By the 8th century AA, Fascesstadt had reached the height of its power. Regulations allowed guilds to conduct economic operations with greater freedom throughout Utland, and a balance between legal and illicit economic activities within the city had been established. Around 792 AA, with the collaboration of the Great Council, Doge **Niccolo Ortez** proposed a partnership to [[House Orvyll]] to extract and process [[Alf Stone|alf stones]], granting access to items with magical properties similar to those of Ard Caëd, under generous terms. However, their offer was rejected by [[House Orvyll#^BertasOrvyll|Lord Bertas Orvyll]]. Later, following the annihilation of the [[Forlornwoods]] by the elven coalition, Fascesstadt lost its access to elven goods, leaving the city’s ambitions to rival elven magic unfulfilled.

Without the involvement of the guilds, it is difficult for anyone to establish the right connections to advance in trade or start a business on the King’s Bank. On the Voivode’s Bank, however, those with sufficient capital could create a sustainable livelihood by selling basic goods such as food, woodwork, or smithing—while relying on the protection of certain factions to avoid being cheated or driven out. Work opportunities existed on both sides of the river, whether for the honest or the unscrupulous.
## Layout
<hr style="margin: 0;">

The city, divided by the Copper River is divided into two banks, Voivode's Bank and King'Bank, which were priorly known as Western Bank and Eastern Bank. Every side of the city is covered by fortified stone walls and towers.

A traveler who would view the city from a distance would see tall and colorfully painted houses, workshops, and gigantic Cathedral of St. Belenus towering over the stone buildings of Voivode's Bank. However, the highest peak of the city is  the inner castle of the city, the old seat of voivodes Paltašić Castle. At night Cathedral of St. Belenus dedicated to the Lightkeeper remains magnificent and glowing even from the farthest edges that has the city's view, its glasses illuminating the city with various colors, to upkeep the philosophy that even in the dark the Lightkeeper's presence may be seen by those still searching.

The banks of the river is connected by *Lemetor's Bridge*, and old stone bridge that connects approximately 250 meters banks apart together, providing a large two winged canal for trade vessels that would pass under it.

Thanks to the Great Council's diplomatic maneuvers, Fascesstadt was untouched during the _War of Flames_.
