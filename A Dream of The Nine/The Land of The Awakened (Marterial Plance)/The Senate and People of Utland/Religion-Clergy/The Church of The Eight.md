His missions are to appoint Cardinals, Bishops, leading important religious ceremonies (including the Senate's ceremonies), making decisions on appointment of advisors to the aristocrat houses of Utland, and holding the office of [[Lexicon#^PontifexMaximus|Pontifex Maximus]] in [[The Senate|the Senate]]. Usually, a Cardinal gets elected as the next Vicar after the Vicar closes his eyes to Somnium. To be elected as the Vicar, one must be a male believer of the Eight.
- **Cardinal:** Cardinals are senior members of the clergy directly appointed by the Vicar, given as an honorary title. They hold this title for a lifetime. They serve as the Vicar's closest advisors and responsible of electing the new Vicar. Usually, Cardinals gets selected from archbishops and bishops. After one becoming a cardinal they may be dismissed from their other duties and be assigned to dicastery of Curia Octo as judges that solves disputes between clergy, as bureaucrats that issues the Vicar's decrees and paperwork managers of church affairs, as diplomats between the church and the state, as inquisitors conduct heresy investigations, as financial managers of Arbitria, and other critical central administrative roles within the church. As their assistants and helpers, with the permission of the Vicar, a cardinal can appoint a pro-cardinal. To become a cardinal one must achieve priesthood.

An archdiocese with some exceptions are usually located within the most metropolitan city of their state. They are the head of the clergy administration in their state. They can call reginal church councils to deal with heresy, reforms, or disputes, can act as advisors to regional powerful aristocrats, could investigate or disciple bishops, and can act as a court of appeal for people about decisions of bishops. Archbishop title can be given by the Vicar himself, or granted to bishop by the former archbishop as a way of passing their duties.

They are responsible of assigning priests to local churches, regulate the priests teachings, investigate heresy, administrate wealth and land of the clergical diocese like a lord, ordain new clergy, settle religious disputes, advising to local rulers, and being chief judges of their diocese. One needs to have served as a priest to take on the role of bishop. For one to become an archbishop, a person should go through an ordination ritual approved by the Vicar, and at least three bishops witnessing and performing in the ritual.
- **Priest:** A priest is responsible of execution of religious rituals, religious education, religious festival days and ceremonies, providing spiritual guidance, caring for poor and sick, managing church property, and play the role of moral authority for the communities of the local churches they are appointed.

They continue to help conduction of rituals more, but still do not hold the authority to lead the rituals. For one to become a Scholasticus, they need to complete their learning of Puer Oblatus. This is the last rank of leity before the person gets accepted to the clergy.
