The Fighter is the shield that guards Somnium from harm and the most skilled master of battle. He values grit, discipline, and strength above all else. To protect the will, one must be willing to face danger to defend those they care for. However, this does not mean that sleepers should pledge their passion or loyalty to anything beyond the Eight gods themselves. The Fighter is a master of all weapons, but his trusted companion is always his shield, the [[Ancile]]. For a battle fought without the intent to defend one’s life is nothing but murder.

Followers of the Fighter inherit the mission of protecting the sleepers from all evil. The knighthood oath is sworn in the name of the Fighter. Those who seek protection, those who face battle, and those who fight against evil pray to the Fighter to defend them with his impenetrable Ancile.

The priests of the Fighter are trained not only in scholarly and religious teachings but also in the arts of combat. Their shields, holy relics entrusted to them, serve as constant reminders of their duties and philosophy. Usually clad in armor, those who serve outside military encampments may occasionally be seen wearing their bordeaux robes. As guards of [[The Church of The Eight|the Church of the Eight]] and protectors of all sleepers, they hold a sacred role within [[The Senate and People of Utland]] military. They declare wars in the name of the gods and fight with divine purpose, while also partaking in the signing of peace treaties—symbolizing the gods’ acknowledgment of war’s end. Serving within the tent churches of Utland’s legion camps, they bless soldiers’ weapons, lead prayers before battle, fight alongside the soldiers, and honor the fallen afterward.

To worship the Fighter, one casts holy water upon the bodies of the foes they have vanquished, whether dead or merely defeated, while reciting prayers in the name of the Fighter—for victory, for strength, and for the banishment of evil. In this act, the fallen are cleansed, so that whatever darkness they carried may not linger to harm Somnium.
