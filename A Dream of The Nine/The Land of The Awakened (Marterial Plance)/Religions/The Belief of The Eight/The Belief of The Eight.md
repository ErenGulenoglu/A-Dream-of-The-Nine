## History
<hr style="margin: 0;">

- Sometime between 100-200 years AA, Lucron the Pure was born.
- Upon reaching adolescence Lucron brought miracles. He healed people with his light, opened eyes of the blind, and even brought back those who died untimely from death.
- He travelled the lands that are now known as the northern Utland, and spread the word of Eight, and brought people together who were separately worshiping to Somniatores.
- Around his thirties he returned to his village, and helped people with constructing a shelter for all dormiens. With his eight apostles he built Arbitria, founded the Church of the Eight, the first church and the land later adopted its name.
- Short after, he fell sick and died. His eight apostles brought the Book of Eight together and took the mission of spreading and defending the word of the Eight. The position of the Vicar is formed as the successor of Lucron the Pure's mission. The first Vicar, Saint Colin.
- On 447 AA, the first church Arbitria gets destroyed by a mysterious fire. Original copies of the Book of Eight gets burned in the fire, and the Vicar Saint Vryon at the time dies within flames. In 449 AA, reconstruction of the central church begins. In AA 451, the central gets completed and gets named after the late Vicar Saint Vryon.
- In 591 AA, [[Chronology of Utland#^OwynI|Owyn I von Ewfai]] united the realm of man, entering Arbitria after successfully besieging the city. He forbade the sack of the city and sent a messenger to Vicar Ugurfil, commanding that everyone except the Vicar vacate the Basilica of Saint Vyron. Owyn I then entered the basilica unarmed, and the doors were closed behind him. When they opened again, Owyn I and the Vicar emerged together, with the Vicar crowning him and proclaiming him the ruler of all mankind, sent by the Eight and a descendant of [[The Fighter|the Fighter]].

## The Book of The Eight
<hr style="margin: 0;">

**_How did the gods come into existence?_**  
In the beginning, there was only [[The Ethereal Fire|the Ethereal Fire]]—a formless blaze of will and potential, burning beyond time and substance. From its flame, the Eight emerged, born not of flesh or fate, but of longing: a search for meaning, and a passion to share the gift of free will. They walked out of the fire, not knowing what they were, only that they must create—and in doing so, shaped the foundations of Somnium.

**_Where did evil came from? Why did they create Somnium and the sleepers?_**  
For there was evil, born in the emptiness—where the light of the Ethereal Fire had not reached—that sought to shackle free will and twist it into chains. To guard this freedom, the Eight shaped a sanctuary: Somnium. A realm of balance and purpose, where their will could take root. They shared their will with their creations—the sleepers—so that when the time came to rest after driving back the evil, there would be those who could protect the dream in their stead.

**_Where are the gods now?_**  
The Eight have withdrawn to Caeleus, the highest realm, after defending **Somnium** from the invasion of evil. With their strength spent and their purpose fulfilled—for now—they entrusted the dream to the sleepers. Somnium is theirs to protect, until the gods return once more.

**_Why do the sleepers go to Caeleus or Avernus after death?_**  
When evil once invaded the dream, it left behind a stain—corruption that clings to the souls of sleepers, whispering vile urges and tempting them astray. In response, the Eight shaped Caeleus and Avernus: realms of retribution and reward. Those who stood fast and upheld the will are welcomed into Caeleus, to dwell among the gods. Those who let evil overcome them are cast into Avernus, where they face the judgment their deeds have earned.
