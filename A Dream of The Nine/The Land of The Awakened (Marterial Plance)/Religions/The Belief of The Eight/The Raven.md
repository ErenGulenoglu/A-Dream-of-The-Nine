The Raven values passion for learning, and knowledge above all. In his mind, a person's intelligence and cunning are the only paths to the protection of the will. For the will’s protection, the wise must possess the mind and the grasp to not fear the things that are to be learned. The unwise break a locked door they need to pass through, not knowing they will later need to shut it for their own safety. The wise know how to sway the lock, its inner mechanisms, making it their own instrument. But the wise should be aware of what course is most fitting at the time. If the lock needs to be broken, it shall be broken.

Followers of the Raven believe that the moral codes of the Eight are open to interpretation, and that for the protection of the will, drastic actions may sometimes be necessary—even those others might deem forbidden. Many civil academy teachers of [[The Senate and People of Utland]] pray to the Raven for knowledge and guidance in learning, while thieves are also known to seek His favor—for cunning and insight to protect the will, as they understand it.

The Raven's priests wear their ceremonial beaked masks with black robes as a symbol of dedication, as well as a display of their knowledge—the length and shape of the masks' beaks change depending on the fields in which they have been educated. The clerics of the Raven are teachers as well as priests. In addition to leading holy rituals in rural areas, they also teach reading, writing, and basic arithmetic.

To worship the Raven, one must reflect on a piece of newly learned knowledge—something gained through effort, study, or insight—and inscribe or recite it with intention upon a chosen medium. If written on paper or parchment, it should be offered to the nearest temple of the Raven, or, if none is present, to a temple of any of the Eight. If no temple is present, the knowledge should be tied to the leg of a bird—preferably a raven—and released to the skies, entrusting the message to the winds. If no bird or suitable paper can be found, the knowledge must still be recorded on any available object, and thanks given to the Raven for his wisdom.
