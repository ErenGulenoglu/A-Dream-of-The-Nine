The Lightkeeper values both material and moral selflessness above all else. She believes that one person’s spark can ignite another’s fire. To protect the will, a soul must be willing to part with what it holds most dear. She granted the sleepers free will by sharing pieces of her own soul with them. Though she is the goddess of the sun and moon, her domain extends wherever even the faintest light shines. The lesser gods—the Sun and the Moon—serve her, yet she values not the light they give, but how each yields to the other. For tomorrow’s dawn to come, today’s light must first surrender to darkness.

The Lightkeeper embraces all sleepers who worship the Eight as her own, guiding them toward peace and warmth by encouraging generosity. She does not forbid wealth earned through honest means, but she may dim the light of those who hoard without offering proper alms. If one cannot share their bread or livelihood, then share kind words—or give what you do not need to someone who does.

Prayers to the Lightkeeper can be heard from the mouths of children as they fall asleep in the dark, from mothers wishing their babies to be born with pure souls untouched by evil, from travelers who journey through the night in hope of dawn, and even from greenskin folk who have renounced their old ties to falsehoods and found peace and belonging among the sleepers under the Lightkeeper’s grace. Among humans, the idea that a greenskin can worship the Eight remains controversial—but as the Lightkeeper is the goddess of all souls, many non-believers who choose to convert, believing that all souls, in the end, returns to the Lady of Light.

The Lightkeeper’s priests wear white robes, adorned with her symbol in yellow on their chests. Her clerics conduct sacrificial rituals for the Eight, and craft candles within their churches so the local folk may have a source of light at night—allowing the Lady to guide them through darkness. After sunset, churches of the Lightkeeper remain bright and visible, their halls aglow with torches, lanterns, and candlelight—not merely to ward off the dark, but so that even in shadow, her presence may be seen by those still searching.

To worship the Lightkeeper, one must light a candle at sunset and keep it burning until sunrise. If during this time someone needs your light more than you do, share it with them. However, the Selfless also accepts other forms of worship: properly paid alms, shared property and kind words, and good deeds done for others. A person may pay their alms by donating to the Church of the Eight, for it will be used to serve those in need. The Lightkeeper lights the path of those who help one another without expectation.
