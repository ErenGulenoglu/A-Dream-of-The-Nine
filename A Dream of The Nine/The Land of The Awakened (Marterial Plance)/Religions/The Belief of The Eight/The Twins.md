The Twins weave the ever-shifting pattern of order and chaos within Somnium. Every hundred years, they exchange their wills—mirroring one another, yet never remaining the same—and continue their weaving in new forms. Fate is fluid, not fixed, and to protect the will, one must embrace their turning within the pattern. Some dare to call the Twins the source of chaos and evil—but without them, there would be no order or good, for all must have their counterpart. In their pattern, every soul has its place.

The thoughts and actions of all creatures spring from the ever-turning pattern the Twins weave—one of motion, change, and contradiction. Their domain reaches into the hearts of all who carry the will, as well as into the sea and sky. They know what stirs the waves into fury, what darkens the clouds with storm, and what keeps one’s inner weather as calm as a summer noon. Prayers to the Twins vary wildly, shaped by the soul of the one who offers them—some seek peace, others turmoil; some ask for rain upon dry fields, others for clear skies above troubled seas. They give as easily as they take, and those who pray to them must be ready for either.

Priests of the Twins wear robes of dark and light blue, reflecting the ever-shifting skies and the restless seas. They serve always in pairs, exchanging their roles, colors, and prayers every two years to honor the cycle of change. Known as augurs, rainmakers, diplomats, and rule-keepers within the [[The Church of The Eight|the Church of the Eight]].

To worship the Twins, the sleepers must embrace the duality of the will by offering a paired sacrifice: one sweet and one bitter food, one cherished possession and one they despise, one that brings joy and one that brings sorrow. These offerings are cast into the open sea, to be carried away by the waves — a tribute to the ever-shifting pattern the Twins weave. For those far from the sea, the sacrifice is burned instead, and the ashes left to dance upon the wind, entrusted to the skies where the pattern of the Twins guides all things unseen.
