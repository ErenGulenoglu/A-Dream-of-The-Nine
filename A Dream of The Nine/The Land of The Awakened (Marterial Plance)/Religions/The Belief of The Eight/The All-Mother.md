The All-Mother awakens with the coming of spring—flowers bloom, crops rise, the earth turns green, and both sleepers and the kin of the wilds are born anew. With the fall, she returns to her slumber, leaving her echoes—the lesser gods—to tend to the wilds in her stead. Yet even in rest, her will does not cease; new life still stirs, be it leaf, animal, or humanoid. She holds the health of sleepers and the balance of nature above all else. 

To protect the will, one must show reverence to life itself—whether it beats within a heart or grows quietly beneath the soil. The All-Mother accepts that for the sleepers to prosper, they must hunt, fell trees, and clear the land to build their homes—but she holds no grudge, so long as her children do not disturb the balance of nature and strive to heal the wounds they leave behind. But the Ever Young does not hesitate to punish those who push beyond the limits of her forbearance, sending famine, drought, sickness, and calamities upon them. The only transgression she never forgives is bringing harm to the Alves—for they are her first creations, and to them, all life returns when its time in Somnium is done.

Elves of [[Ard Caëd]] worship the All-Mother as the sole deity and the mother of all other gods, believing that the Alves are her living avatar within Somnium. They call her _Nebula_—she who is of nature.

The All-Mother’s priests’ robes are almost always worn—from bright to earth-stained green—since they do not stay in one place but travel wherever they are needed most, except in rare cases. The clerics of the All-Mother are known as healers, agriculturists, midwives, and herbalists. They are ritually known for blessing the harvest, performing sacrifices, and sanctifying births.

To worship the All-Mother is to show love for the will she placed in all living things across Somnium. Planting a tree is considered one of the purest expressions of this love—a sacred act of devotion. To care for the tree—watering it, tending to its growth, and pruning its branches—is among the most common forms of worship. Yet the All-Mother does not forsake those who cannot plant. For them, worship may take the form of marrying, bringing new life into the world, caring for their animals with kindness, or practicing mindful agriculture.
