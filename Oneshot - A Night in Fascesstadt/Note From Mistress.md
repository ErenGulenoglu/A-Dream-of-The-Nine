Greetings, *rivvil-toy*,

Your companion, that simpering _jaluk_, crawled to our feet to beg for an artifact the miserable _darthiir_ refuse to grant you. We, in our generosity, will bestow this trinket upon you—_elamshin_ guiding our hand—so that the surface-dwelling “lords of commerce” you so proudly claim may press their weight more firmly against the weak-willed _darthiir_.

The Stone of Alf bears an arcane weave of Disintegrate within its heart. Any barrier crafted by the wretched darthiir shall collapse at its touch. It will indeed shatter the ward you seek to break around Greenfort. Take heed, rivvil: do not tempt the stone’s hunger near your own flesh, unless you wish your body to scatter like dust upon the Underdark winds.
