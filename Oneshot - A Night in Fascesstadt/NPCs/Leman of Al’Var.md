**Leman of Al'Var** was a half-elf **bard** born in [[Al'Var]] in the year 767 AA. He had a daughter named **[[Linda of Al'var|Linda]]**, a quarter-elf with arcane in her blood, born in 838 AA. Leman lived most of his life wandering across the Land of the Awakened, playing his tunes, working as a musician and mercenary, until he one day learned that a tavern girl he once had an affair with had borne him a child. After meeting his infant daughter, Leman left his adventuring life, took Linda with him, and settled in [[Fascesstadt]].

Seeking to build a stable future and a business for his family on King's Bank, Leman took the role of a fixer, providing valuable information and materials to both sides of the river using the network he had built during his adventuring years.

Through a contact from his former adventuring party—an elf of his kin with ties to the underdark—Leman obtained an [[Alf Stone|alf stone]] etched with strange runes, capable of dissolving the barrier around [[Greenfort]]. This was an opportunity the Great Council had long desired but had never managed to secure.

Seeing a chance, Leman established a line of communication with several established guild families to reach an agreement on lifting the magical seal placed upon the [[Alf Stone|alf stone]] mine of [[House Orvyll]].

Before he could complete his plan, however, Leman was arrested on the accusation of assassinating Doge **Terentius Martini**. He was hanged—along with his daughter in 857 AA.
