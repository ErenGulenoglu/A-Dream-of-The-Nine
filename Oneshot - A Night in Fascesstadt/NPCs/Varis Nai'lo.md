**Varis Nai'lo** was a wood elf **assassin** and the leader of [[Acutus]], an illicit organization in [[Fascesstadt]] specializing in contract killings. Once a close ally of [[Leman of Al’Var]], their relationship fractured when Varis learned that Leman had been working for **both sides of the river**, and—more importantly—after discovering Leman’s ambition to become a mediator of [[Alf Stone|alf stones]] for Fascesstadt. Such a move would inevitably draw the attention of both [[Ard Caëd]] and [[Dol Caëd]] to the city, unsettling many on Voivode’s Bank, including Varis.

In the spring of **857 AA**, Varis assassinated Doge **Terentius Martini**, framing Leman by planting the assassination weapon beneath his bed. This act led directly to the execution of both Leman and his daughter, **Linda**.
