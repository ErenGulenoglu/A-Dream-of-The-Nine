## Summary
This small adventure tells the background story of [[Marsh Rivers]] — how his found family died, and how his new purpose in [[Forlornwoods]] was forged. The events begin in **853 AA** and conclude in **857 AA**.

At the start of the adventure, Marsh and a group of his friends are given a task by [[Leman of Al’Var|Leman]] and [[Varis Nai'lo|Varis]]: to collect a delivery from a courier who is a longtime friend of Leman. Unbeknownst to the players, the items they are asked to retrieve will set in motion the downfall of both Leman and Varis. Leman, unaware that Varis plans to betray him, believes the elf to be an ally — but Varis, along with other figures on the wrong side of the river, has grown increasingly uneasy with Leman’s habit of working for _both_ banks of the city.

The deliveries are as follows:
- **Leman’s package:** an [[Alf Stone|alf stone]] etched with strange, undecipherable elvish runes (Drowish), imbued with disintegration magic capable of destroying the _wall of force_ barrier surrounding [[Greenfort]].
- **Varis’s package:** an elven magical blade — a finely crafted assassination weapon.
After the party picks up the delivery, they run into a group of local bully children who attempt to rob them. Whether or not the group overcomes this conflict, they eventually return to the city.

The story then jumps forward **four years**, leading to the public hanging of Leman and his daughter, [[Linda of Al'var]]. Leman is accused of assassinating Doge **Terentius Martini**, while Linda faces charges of practicing arcane arts illegally.

The adventure concludes with Marsh abandoning the city — the beginning of his journey toward the [[Forlornwoods]].

Some rules:
- In 853 AA, the characters only have clothes on their back and a knife. Spellcasters have their humble focuses.
- They get their full item once time skip to 857 AA happens.
## Scene 0: On The Roof

	"About fifteen years after the War of Flames, the new republic still struggles to mend the wounds left by the fallen kingdom. In Ewyngard, the Senate remains locked in endless debate—whose lands suffered most, which regions deserve investment, and where the new trade routes should run. Along the southern border of Utland, villages lie abandoned and ruined. Distant, once-prosperous human tribes and cities have taken the collapse of the Kingdom of Utland as a chance to reclaim their freedom, refusing taxes and declaring independence.
	The smallfolk—the farmers, herders, taxpayers, militia members, and the backbone of Utland—have suffered everywhere. Those near the southern border were cut down by elven blades and spells or fled, becoming paupers in safer regions. Those in places untouched by the war still paid ever-rising taxes, surrendered livestock and harvests, sent their sons to distant battlefields, and watched their livelihoods shrink year after year.
	Those who stayed loyal to King Galvyn II von Ewfai are now dead, landless, impoverished, or forgotten. Those who rose against his tyranny were executed as traitors.
	It has been fifteen years since the flames of war died out. Our story begins in a place the fire never reached—where loyalty is fluid, survival is pragmatic, and ambitions shift like river currents.
	 Fascesstadt, heart of the Riverlands-western province of the SPQU, is a large fortress-city built around the widest branch of the Copper River. By land, the western trade route of Utland passes directly through the city; by river, dwarven goods from Broken Mountains and goods from northern coastal settlements of Utland all flow into its bustling markets. Granted autonomy long ago under the Kingdom of Utland, Fascesstadt chose to remain within the republic on its own terms.
	 Officially, the city is governed as a Merchant Republic, ruled by a council of merchants, bourgeois families, and guildmasters. Unofficially, however, kleptocracy dominates life here—money, corruption, blackmail, thievery, and murder shape both politics and the streets. True to their nature, the city’s rulers negotiated with the elves during the war and stayed well away from the fighting.
	Our characters are street kids in their early teens who have spent most of their lives in Fascesstadt. As the sun sets, they sit on the rooftops of tightly packed, multi-story buildings of King's Bank, their legs dangling over the edge. From their perch they watch the Copper River flow through the heart of the city, observe crowds moving through the streets below, and look toward a hanging taking place before the Cathedral of St. Belenus.
- Everyone introduces their characters.
- Describe procedure of hanging.
- Earlier morning, Leman has told Marsh to find him at [[The Traveler’s Lantern|the Traveler’s Lantern]] after the sunset, and Varis told the others to come to the same tavern at the evening.
## Scene 1: The Traveler's Lantern
	The Traveler’s Lantern is a busy, well-known three-story tavern on the Voivode’s Bank. Two half-orc bouncers stand at the front doors, watching everyone who steps inside. They let you in because they know you. The interior is crowded and lively. A raised platform sits at the center of the room, used by musicians throughout the night. Lanterns hung around its edge cast warm light over the performers. Tables and chairs are arranged in a wide circle around the stage. The second floor wraps around the room, its middle partly open so patrons upstairs can look down at the musicians below. From both levels, the tavern is filled with overlapping voices, laughter, clattering mugs, and the steady rumble of conversation.
- Leman and Varis sit together on the first floor near the stage of **The Traveler’s Lantern**.
    
- They explain that they must attend a meeting on King’s Bank. Before they leave, they assign the children a task:
    - **Go to the old well**,
    - **Collect two deliveries** from Leman’s contact:
        - one meant for **Leman**,
        - one meant for **Varis**,
    - **Bring both back to the tavern**.
- The task is given to the children because, as Varis explains, “people notice children less,” making them ideal for a discreet handoff.
- Leman and Varis promise to return by midnight.
    - Before leaving, Varis discreetly uses *thieves’ cant* to question the children—everyone _except_ Marsh—to try to uncover what Leman’s delivery might be.
- About two hours later, a well-dressed butler enters the tavern and whispers something to Leman.
- Leman, Varis, and the butler depart for King’s Bank in the carriage he brought, while the children set out to retrieve the two deliveries.
## Scene 2: The Old Well
	The old well lies about an hour’s walk from The Traveler’s Lantern. The further you travel, the more the streets shift into a derelict district of abandoned warehouses, stardust addicts, and a few scattered homes whose residents would never answer a call for help. With each step, the city’s noise fades until all that remains is the echo of your own footsteps.
	As you approach the old well, you spot a **darkly cloaked figure—shorter than an average male adult—leaning against the wooden wall of a nearby abandoned warehouse, not trying to hide himself.
- [[G'eldfryn Do'ghym]], an old adventurer friend of Leman waits leaning.
- Perception 12 reveals next to the cloaked person there is a sign etched on the wooden wall, meaning "delivery" in *thieves' cant*.
- A thug who is passing the street likes clothes of G'eldfryn Do'ghym, and threatens to kill him if he does not hand over the rest of his stuff with his clothes. G'eldfryn Do'ghym with unseen agility appears next to the thug and kills him, tossing his body to aside.
- G'eldfryn Do'ghym has two things to deliver:
	- A rectangular abanoze box, equal to a size of an arm. (In this box there is an elven sword, +2 _Shortsword of Sharpness_ coated with _drow poison_).
	- A small black velvet pouch, that has a small alf stone etched with strange runes that looks like elvish (drowish). And [[Note From Mistress|a small, rolled parchment]].
- He tells children that he isn't hearing good things about Leman in the city. People tell that he is working for the both sides of the river.
## Scene 3: Big Fish Eats Small Fish
While on their way back, **three kids** who had been following them cut off their path: **Lonny**, **Tom**, and **Sam**. After Lonny dies or falls unconscious, the remaining urchins must roll a _courage die each turn_ to decide whether they **run** or **continue fighting** for the deliveries.
- The urchins demand the party **hand over whatever they got from “the guy.”** Combat begins if refused.
- **Lonny — Stats:** +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, 12 HP
- **Tom and Sam — Stats:** +2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom, 8 HP
- **Weapons:** All three carry knives _(1d4 + Str/Dex)_
## Scene 4: A Good Four Year's Rest
- Upon their return, a couple of hours before midnight, **Leman** and **Varis** arrive at the tavern. They immediately ask the children if they have brought back the deliveries.
- Varis, in particular, expects additional information about **Leman’s delivery**.
- Once the exchanges are complete, the tavernkeeper approaches and requests a musical performance from Leman. He invites **Marsh** onto the stage. As they sing together, the story transitions forward **four years**, bridging the time to the eventual events that follow.
- Once they step down from the stage together, **Leman** tells **Marsh** that he and **Linda** will be away from the city for a few days. He entrusts his lyre to Marsh.
- After Leman leaves, **Linda** takes Marsh’s hand and tells him that she has “learned something he will certainly want to see.” She leads him to the rooftop of one of the Voivode’s Bank buildings, offering a full view of the Cathedral of St. Belenus at night, its stained glass illuminated in a riot of colors.
- Meanwhile, **Varis** and the rest of Marsh’s friends, who are sitting at a separate table, rise. Varis approaches Leman’s table:
	- Before leaving, he hands them a **rectangular abanoze box** and instructs them to place it under Leman’s bed in his room on the third floor.
- **Lockpicking:** DC 10 to access the room.
- Once Marsh and Linda reach the rooftop overlooking the colorful, illuminated city, Linda compliments Marsh on his performance and asks about his future plans. As she begins to reveal her secret, she casts a **sleep spell** on him, rendering him unconscious.
## Scene 5: The Hanging
- Marsh awakens to the tolling of the Cathedral of St. Belenus’ bell, its heavy echoes rolling through the city. As he blinks the sleep from his eyes and looks down from the rooftop, he sees hundreds of city guards flooding the streets, driving everyone toward the market square.
- The guards show open aggression toward anyone coming from the _wrong side of the river_—pushing, shouting, and even striking those who dare question their behavior.
- When Marsh reaches the market square, a massive crowd has gathered around the gallows. Standing on the platform is a man in a yellow jacket, a representative of the Great Council.
- As Leman and Linda are dragged up the steps—hands and mouths bound—the councilman announces their crimes:
	- the murder of the Doge, and witchery
- The man on the platform raises the murder weapon for all to see: the **same blade the children delivered to Varis four years ago**.
- Among the crowd are **Varis** and the other players. Varis asks if anyone has seen Marsh and, receiving no answer, tells them to **search the crowd for him**.
## Scene 6: Leaving The City
- Marsh leaves the city in sorrow, carrying only the **lyre of his master**. While traveling, he discovers a hidden compartment within the instrument—inside rests the pouch from four years ago, untouched since the night of the delivery.
- Realizing its significance, Marsh changes his course and heads toward Forlornwoods, determined to fulfill his master’s vision.
